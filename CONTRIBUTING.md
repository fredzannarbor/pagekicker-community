# Contributing Guidelines

Please submit pull requests!

 - Pull request titles and commit messages should have the form `FIELD: FULL NAME`, e.g., `mathematics: Tim Gowers`
 - Each expert should come paired with a single blog post representative of the field they represent and the quality of their writing.
 - Experts may be repeated in mutliple fields if they represent multiple fields. Submit a separate link for each subfield.
 - Good writers are preferred.
 - Detailed writers are preferred.
 - Writers who make effort to spread knowledge are preferred.
 - Active writers are preferred (inactive writers may be included, but will be placed in a separate archival location)

I get the final say in what is included. If you don't like my guidelines, you're welcome to fork :)
