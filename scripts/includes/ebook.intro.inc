This e-book has been built programmatically, on the fly, by Nimble Combinatorial Publishing, using a combination of open access, public domain, user-contributed, and permissioned data. While we are constantly working on improving the process for identifying, fetching, and assembling the contents, it is fair to say that there may well be blemishes or gaffes as a result of this programmatic approach. This may seem slapdash, but there are some unique benefits that, we hope, will make these e-books worth their modest price. In many cases, our approach allows us to assemble a wealth of relevant and reasonably high quality content on a particular set of topics that outmatches anything that is available in e-book format anywhere else. The simple reason for this is that there just are not as many books as there are interesting and important topics.  There are 1 million plus ebooks in the Amazon Kindle store, but the Nimble Combinatorial Publishing content repository already includes more than 10 million documents, which can be selected, combined, and annotated in <a href="http://store.nimblebooks.com/magento/index.php/fun-facts/?___store=default">an almost inconceivably large number of combinations and permutations.</a> Furthermore, our programmatic approach enables us to build huge volumes of books in a given category at the push of a key, and to create new ebooks immediately when random topics become hot trends.<p>
