# Build A New Book

## On PageKicker.com

You can short-circuit--indeed, electrocute!--the months of hard work that go into creating a book by using PageKicker's authoring [workbench](https://www.pagekicker.com/index.php/workbench). PageKicker is an early stage startup in Ann Arbor, Michigan that has been featured in publications such as Forbes, Gizmodo, dzone, and the Boston Globe.   Fill out a simple one-page form and PageKicker will create a catalog entry and add it to your personal bookshelf, where you can order it, share it with friends, and sell via our online store.  Because the books are only built when ordered, and can always be upgraded on request, they are constantly improving, and have the benefit both of PageKicker's latest software and the latest content.  It's a unique approach that is truly a better way to stocking your shelves with nonfiction for deep learning.
