# Chatbot Scenario for PageKicker

Hello!  Tell me about the nonfiction book you would like me to build.

What will the title be?

What are some key phrases that describe the content?

What would the dust jacket description say?

Where would you expect to find it in a book store?

[BISAC top-level category picker]

How should the byline read?

Thanks! I will now build an electronic book for you with this information.

From IA Laurie Lamar:

> If you're going to use a chatbot to collect parameters, consider delaying some of the questions until after the book is built.  For example:
> - It might be more fun for the user to "see" the book being built (perhaps an animated progress indicator showing pages being added),
> - Then make other choices such as selecting a cover , after the book is built.
> - Perhaps add options for editing and/or sharing the book with others.

My response:

> PageKicker's most validated by $$$ use case at this point is as a

> from blank page to half-way done.  Thus gathering parameters and 
> narrowing them down is important. What I would really like is to be 
> able to say "PageKicker, build me a book about X", then have the 
> system elicit parameters and burrow down into tradeoffs, all of which 
> would create & launch a command line, that could then be saved for 
> future use by the operator.
