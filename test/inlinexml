PAELLA


Paella (Catalan pronunciation: [paˈeʎa] or [pəˈeʎə], Spanish: [paˈeʎa];
English approximation: or ) is a Valencian rice dish. Paella has ancient
roots, but its modern form originated in the mid-19th century in the
area around <LOCATION>Albufera</LOCATION> lagoon on the east coast of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, adjacent to the
city of <LOCATION>Valencia</LOCATION>. Many non-Spaniards view paella as <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>’s national
dish, but most Spaniards consider it to be a regional Valencian dish.
Valencians, in turn, regard paella as one of their identifying symbols.

Types of paella include Valencian paella, vegetarian/vegan paella
(Spanish: paella de verduras), seafood paella (Spanish: paella de
marisco), and mixed paella (Spanish: paella mixta), among many others.
Valencian paella is believed to be the original recipe and consists of
white rice, green beans (bajoqueta and tavella), meat (chicken and
rabbit), white beans (garrofón), snails, and seasoning such as saffron
and rosemary. Another very common but seasonal ingredient is artichokes.
Seafood paella replaces meat with seafood and omits beans and green
vegetables. Mixed paella is a free-style combination of meat from land
animals, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes beans. Most paella chefs use
bomba rice due to it being less likely to overcook, but Valencians tend
to use a slightly stickier (and thus more susceptible to overcooking)
variety known as <PERSON>Senia</PERSON>. All types of paellas use olive oil.


Etymology

Paella is a Valencian word which derives from the Old French word paelle
for pan, which in turn comes from the Latin word patella for pan.

The word paella is also related to paila used in many Latin American
countries. Paila in the Spanish language of <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> refers to a
variety of cookware resembling metal and clay pans, which are also used
for both cooking and serving.

The Latin root patella from which paella derives is also akin to the
modern French poêle, the Italian padella and the Old Spanish padilla.

Valencians use the word paella for all pans in the Valencian language,
including the specialized shallow pan used for cooking paellas. However,
in most other parts of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and throughout Hispanic <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> where the
Spanish language is spoken (as opposed to the Valencian language), the
term paellera (“paella pan”) is more commonly used for the specialised
pan while paella is reserved for the rice dish prepared in it, although
both terms are deemed correct for the pan, as stated by the <ORGANIZATION>Royal
Spanish Academy</ORGANIZATION>, the body responsible for regulating the Spanish
language in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. Paelleras are traditionally round, shallow, and made
of polished steel with two handles.


History

Possible origins

Moors in Muslim <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> began rice cultivation around the 10th century.
Consequently, Valencians often made casseroles of rice, fish, and spices
for family gatherings and religious feasts, thus establishing the custom
of eating rice in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. This led to rice becoming a staple by the 15th
century. Afterwards, it became customary for cooks to combine rice with
vegetables, beans, and dry cod, providing an acceptable meal for Lent.
Along <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>’s eastern coast, rice was predominantly eaten with fish.

Spanish food historian <PERSON>Lourdes</PERSON> March notes that the dish “symbolizes the
union and heritage of two important cultures, the Roman, which gives us
the utensil and the Arab which brought us the basic food of humanity for
centuries.”

Valencian paella

On special occasions, 18th century Valencians used calderos to cook rice
in the open air of their orchards near lake <LOCATION>Albufera</LOCATION>. Water vole meat
was one of the main ingredients of early paellas, along with eel and
butter beans. Novelist <PERSON>Vicente Blasco Ibáñez</PERSON> described the Valencian
custom of eating water voles in <LOCATION>Cañas</LOCATION> y Barro (1902), a realistic novel
about life among the fishermen and peasants near lake <LOCATION>Albufera</LOCATION>.

Living standards rose with the sociological changes of the late 19th
century in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, giving rise to gatherings and outings in the
countryside. This led to a change in paella’s ingredients, as well,
using instead rabbit, chicken, duck and sometimes snails. This dish
became so popular that in 1840, a local Spanish newspaper first used the
word paella to refer to the recipe rather than the pan.

The most widely used, complete ingredient list of this era was:
short-grain white rice, chicken, rabbit, snails (optional), duck
(optional), butter beans, great northern beans, runner beans, artichoke
(a substitute for runner beans in the winter), tomatoes, fresh rosemary,
sweet paprika, saffron, garlic (optional), salt, olive oil, and water.
Poorer Valencians, however, sometimes used nothing more than snails for
meat. Valencians insist that only these ingredients should go into
making modern Valencian paella.

Seafood and mixed paella

On the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> coast, Valencians used seafood instead of meat and
beans to make paella. Valencians regard this recipe as authentic, as
well. In this recipe, the seafood is served in the shell. A variant on
this is paella del senyoret which uses seafood without shells. Later,
however, Spaniards living outside of <LOCATION>Valencia</LOCATION> combined seafood with meat
from land animals and mixed paella was born. This paella is sometimes
called preparación barroca (baroque preparation) due to the variety of
ingredients and its final presentation.

During the 20th century, paella’s popularity spread past <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>’s
borders. As other cultures set out to make paella, the dish invariably
acquired regional influences. Consequently, paella recipes went from
being relatively simple to including a wide variety of seafood, meat,
sausage (including chorizo), vegetables and many different seasonings.
However, the most globally popular recipe is seafood paella.

Throughout non-Valencian <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, mixed paella is very popular. Some
restaurants in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> (and many in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>) that serve this
mixed version refer to it as Valencian paella. However, Valencians
insist that only the original two Valencian recipes are authentic, and
generally view all others as inferior, not genuine, or even grotesque.


Basic cooking methods

According to tradition in <LOCATION>Valencia</LOCATION>, paella is cooked over an open fire,
fueled by orange and pine branches along with pine cones. This produces
an aromatic smoke which infuses the paella. Also, dinner guests
traditionally eat directly out of the paellera.

Some recipes call for paella to be covered and left to settle for five
to ten minutes after cooking.

Valencian paella

This recipe is standardized because Valencians consider it traditional
and very much part of their culture. Rice in Valencian paella is never
braised in oil, as pilaf, though the paella made further southwest of
<LOCATION>Valencia</LOCATION> often is.

Heat oil in a paella.

Sauté meat after seasoning with salt.

Add green vegetables and sauté until soft.

Add garlic (optional), grated tomatoes, beans and sauté.

Add paprika and sauté.

Add water, saffron (or food coloring), snails (optional) and rosemary.

Boil to make broth and allow it to reduce by half.

Remove the rosemary once flavour has infused or it starts to fall apart.

Add rice and simmer until rice is cooked.

Garnish with more fresh rosemary.

Seafood paella

Recipes for this dish vary somewhat, even in <LOCATION>Valencia</LOCATION>. The recipe below
is based on the two cited here.

Make a seafood broth from shrimp heads, onions, garlic and bay leaves.

Heat oil in a paellera.

Add mussels. <PERSON>Cook</PERSON> until they open and then remove.

Sauté <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> lobster and whole, deep-water rose shrimp. Then remove both
the lobster and shrimp.

Add chopped cuttlefish and sauté.

Add shrimp tails and sauté.

Add garlic and sauté.

Add grated tomato and sauté.

Add rice and braise in sofrito.

Add paprika and sauté.

Add seafood broth and then saffron (or food coloring).

Add salt to taste.

Add the deep-water rose shrimp, mussels and <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> lobster that were set
aside.

Simmer until rice is cooked.

Mixed paella

There are countless mixed paella recipes. The following method is common
to most of these. Seasoning depends greatly on individual preferences
and regional influences. However, salt, saffron and garlic are almost
always included.

Make a broth from seafood, chicken, onions, garlic, bell peppers and bay
leaf.

Heat oil in a paellera.

Sear red bell pepper strips and set aside.

Sear crustaceans and set aside.

Season meat lightly with salt and sauté meat until golden brown.

Add onions, garlic and bell peppers. Sauté until vegetables are tender.

Add grated tomatoes and sauté.

Add dry seasonings except for salt.

Add rice.

Braise rice until covered with sofrito.

Add broth.

Add salt to taste.

Add saffron (or food coloring) and mix well.

Simmer until rice is almost cooked.

Re-place crustaceans.

Continue simmering until rice and crustaceans are finished cooking.

Garnish with seared red bell pepper strips.

For all recipes

After cooking paella, there is usually a layer of toasted rice at the
bottom of the pan, called socarrat in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. This is considered a
delicacy among Spaniards and is essential to a good paella. The toasted
rice develops on its own if the paella is cooked over a burner or open
fire. If cooked in an oven, however, it will not. To correct this, place
the paellera over a high flame while listening to the rice toast at the
bottom of the pan. Once the aroma of toasted rice wafts upwards, it is
removed from the heat. The paella must then sit for about five minutes
(most recipes recommend the paella be covered with a tea-towel at this
point) to absorb the remaining broth.


Competitions and records

It has become a custom at mass gatherings in the Valencian Community
(festivals, political campaigns, protests, etc.) to prepare enormous
paellas, sometimes to win mention in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Chefs use gargantuan paelleras for these events.

Valencian restaurateur <PERSON>Juan Galbis</PERSON> claims to have made the world’s
largest paella with help from a team of workers on 2 October 2001. This
paella fed about 110,000 people according to <PERSON>Galbis</PERSON>’ former website.
<PERSON>Galbis</PERSON> says this paella was even larger than his earlier world-record
paella made on 8 March 1992 which fed about 100,000 people. <PERSON>Galbis</PERSON>’s
record-breaking 1992 paella is listed in Guinness World Records.


Controversy

Many chefs around the world have taken the traditional dish and added
ingredients, such as chorizo, that are considered not to belong in the
dish by Valencians. Spaniards, especially people from <LOCATION>Valencia</LOCATION>, have
complained about this many times and it is a recurrent topic online. The
alternative name proposed for these dishes, although pejorative, is
“Arroz con cosas” (rice with things). Famous cases are <PERSON>Jamie Oliver</PERSON>’s
paella recipe and <PERSON>Gordon Ramsay</PERSON>. The author <PERSON>Josep Pla</PERSON> once noted:

The abuses committed in the name of <LOCATION>Paella Valenciana</LOCATION>, are excessive -
an absolute scandal.


Similar dishes

Traditional Valencian cuisine offers recipes similar to paella
valenciana and paella de marisco such as arròs negre, arròs al forn,
arròs a banda and arròs amb fesols i naps. Fideuà is a noodle dish
variation of the paella cooked in a similar fashion, though it may be
served with allioli sauce.
