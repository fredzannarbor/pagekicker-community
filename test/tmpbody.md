## Paella



Paella (Valencian pronunciation: [paˈeʎa] or [pəˈeʎə], Spanish: [paˈeʎa]; English approximation: /pɑːˈeɪlə, -ˈeɪljə, -ˈeɪjə, -ˈɛlə, -ˈjɛlə/ or /paɪˈɛlə/) is a Valencian rice dish with ancient roots that originated in its modern form in the mid-19th century near Albufera lagoon on the east coast of Spain adjacent to the city of Valencia. Many non-Spaniards view paella as Spain's national dish, but most Spaniards consider it to be a regional Valencian dish. Valencians, in turn, regard paella as one of their identifying symbols.

Types of paella include Valencian paella (Spanish: paella valenciana), vegetarian/vegan paella (Spanish: paella de verduras), seafood paella (Spanish: paella de marisco), and mixed paella (Spanish: paella mixta), but there are many others as well. Valencian paella is believed to be the original recipe and consists of white rice, green beans (bajoqueta and tavella), meat (chicken and rabbit), white beans (garrofón), snails, and seasoning such as saffron and rosemary. Another very common but seasonal ingredient is artichoke. Seafood paella replaces meat with seafood and omits beans and green vegetables. Mixed paella is a free-style combination of meat from land animals, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes beans. Most paella chefs use bomba rice due to it being harder to overcook, but Valencians tend to use a slightly stickier (and thus more susceptible to overcooking) variety known as Senia. All types of paellas use olive oil.





### Etymology ##

Paella is a Valencian word which derives from the Old French word paelle for pan, which in turn comes from the Latin word patella for pan as well. Patella is also akin to the modern French poêle, the Italian padella and the Old Spanish padilla.

Valencians use the word paella for all pans, including the specialized shallow pan used for cooking paellas. However, in most other parts of Spain and throughout Latin America, the term paellera is more commonly used for this pan, though both terms are correct, as stated by the Royal Spanish Academy, the body responsible for regulating the Spanish language in Spain. Paelleras are traditionally round, shallow and made of polished steel with two handles.





### History ##





#### Possible origins ###



The Moors of Moorish Spain began rice cultivation around the 10th century. Consequently, residents of the Valencian region often made casseroles of rice, fish and spices for family gatherings and religious feasts, thus establishing the custom of eating rice in Spain. This led to rice becoming a staple by the 15th century. Afterwards, it became customary for cooks to combine rice with vegetables, beans and dry cod, providing an acceptable meal for Lent. Along Spain's eastern coast, rice was predominantly eaten with fish.

Spanish food historian Lourdes March notes that the dish "symbolizes the union and heritage of two important cultures, the Roman, which gives us the utensil and the Arab which brought us the basic food of humanity for centuries."





#### Valencian paella ###

On special occasions, 18th century Valencians used calderos to cook rice in the open air of their orchards near lake Albufera. Water vole meat was one of the main ingredients of early paellas, along with eel and butter beans. Novelist Vicente Blasco Ibáñez described the Valencian custom of eating water voles in Cañas y Barro (1902), a realistic novel about life among the fishermen and peasants near lake Albufera.

Living standards rose with the sociological changes of the late 19th century in Spain, giving rise to gatherings and outings in the countryside. This led to a change in paella's ingredients as well, using instead rabbit, chicken, duck and sometimes snails. This dish became so popular that in 1840 a local Spanish newspaper first used the word paella to refer to the recipe rather than the pan.

The most widely used, complete ingredient list of this era was as follows: short-grain white rice, chicken, rabbit, snails (optional), duck (optional), butter beans, great northern beans, runner beans, artichoke (a substitute for runner beans in the winter), tomatoes, fresh rosemary, sweet paprika, saffron, garlic (optional), salt, olive oil and water. Poorer Valencians, however, sometimes used nothing more than snails for meat. Valencians insist that only these ingredients should go into making modern Valencian paella.





#### Seafood and mixed paella ###



On the Mediterranean coast, Valencians used seafood instead of meat and beans to make paella. Valencians regard this recipe as authentic as well. In this recipe, the seafood is served in the shell. A variant on this is paella del senyoret which utilizes seafood without shells. Later, however, Spaniards living outside of Valencia combined seafood with meat from land animals and mixed paella was born. This paella is sometimes called "preparación barroca" (baroque preparation) due to the variety of ingredients and its final presentation.

During the 20th century, paella's popularity spread past Spain's borders. As other cultures set out to make paella, the dish invariably acquired regional influences. Consequently, paella recipes went from being relatively simple to including a wide variety of seafood, meat, sausage, (even chorizo) vegetables and many different seasonings. However, the most globally popular recipe is seafood paella.

Throughout non-Valencian Spain, mixed paella is very popular. Some restaurants in Spain (and many in the United States) that serve this mixed version, refer to it as Valencian paella. However, Valencians insist only the original two Valencian recipes are authentic. They generally view all others as inferior, not genuine or even grotesque.





### Basic cooking methods ##

According to tradition in Valencia, paella is cooked over an open fire, fueled by orange and pine branches along with pine cones. This produces an aromatic smoke which infuses the paella. Also, dinner guests traditionally eat directly out of the paellera.

Some recipes call for paella to be covered and left to settle for five or ten minutes after cooking.





#### Valencian paella ###



This recipe is standardized because Valencians consider it traditional and very much part of their culture. Rice in Valencian paella is never braised in oil, as pilaf, though the paella made further southwest of Valencia often is.

Heat oil in a paella.

Sauté meat after seasoning with salt.

Add green vegetables and sauté until soft.

Add garlic (optional), grated tomatoes, beans and sauté.

Add paprika and sauté.

Add water, saffron (and/or food coloring), snails (optional) and rosemary.

Boil to make broth and allow it to reduce by half.

Remove the rosemary once flavour has infused or it starts to fall apart.

Add rice and simmer until rice is cooked.

Garnish with more fresh rosemary.





#### Seafood paella ###



Recipes for this dish vary somewhat, even in Valencia. Below is a recipe by Juanry Segui, a prominent Valencian chef.

Make a seafood broth from shrimp heads, onions, garlic and bay leaves.

Heat oil in a paellera.

Add mussels. Cook until they open and then remove.

Sauté Norway lobster and whole, deep-water rose shrimp. Then remove both the lobster and shrimp.

Add chopped cuttlefish and sauté.

Add shrimp tails and sauté.

Add chunks of whitefish.

Add garlic and sauté.

Add grated tomato and sauté.

Add rice and braise in sofrito.

Add paprika and sauté.

Add seafood broth and then saffron (and/or food coloring).

Add salt to taste.

Add the deep-water rose shrimp, mussels and Norway lobster that were set aside.

Simmer until rice is cooked.





#### Mixed paella ###



There are countless mixed paella recipes. The following method is common to most of these. Seasoning depends greatly on individual preferences and regional influences. However, salt, saffron and garlic are almost always included.

Make a broth from seafood, chicken, onions, garlic, bell peppers and bay leaf.

Heat oil in a paellera.

Sear red bell pepper strips and set aside.

Sear crustaceans and set aside.

Season meat lightly with salt and sauté meat until golden brown.

Add onions, garlic and bell peppers. Sauté until vegetables are tender.

Add grated tomatoes and sauté.

Add dry seasonings except for salt.

Add rice.

Braise rice until covered with sofrito.

Add broth.

Add salt to taste.

Add saffron (and/or food coloring) and mix well.

Simmer until rice is almost cooked.

Re-place crustaceans.

Continue simmering until rice and crustaceans are finished cooking.

Garnish with seared red bell pepper strips.





#### For all recipes ###

After cooking paella, there is usually a layer of toasted rice at the bottom of the pan, called socarrat in Spain. This is considered a delicacy among Spaniards and is essential to a good paella. The toasted rice develops on its own if the paella is cooked over a burner or open fire. If cooked in an oven, however, it will not. To correct this, place the paellera over a high flame while listening to the rice toast at the bottom of the pan. Once the aroma of toasted rice wafts upwards, it is removed from the heat. The paella must then sit for about five minutes (most recipes recommend the paella be covered with a tea-towel at this point) to absorb the remaining broth.





### Competitions and records ##

It has become a custom at mass gatherings in the Valencian Community (festivals, political campaigns, protests, etc.) to prepare enormous paellas, sometimes to win mention in the Guinness Book of World Records. Chefs use gargantuan paelleras for these events.

Valencian restaurateur Juan Galbis claims to have made the world's largest paella with help from a team of workers on 2 October 2001. This paella fed about 110,000 people according to Galbis' former website. Galbis says this paella was even larger than his earlier world-record paella made on 8 March 1992 which fed about 100,000 people. Galbis's record-breaking 1992 paella is listed in Guinness World Records.

## Arròs negre



Arròs negre (Valencian pronunciation: [aˈrɔz ˈneɣɾe], Spanish: arroz negro) is a Valencian and Catalan dish made with cuttlefish (or squid) and rice, somewhat similar to seafood paella. Some mistakenly call it paella negra ("black paella" in Spanish), however it is traditionally not called a paella even though it is prepared in the same manner.

Arròs negre should not be confused with black rice, the collective name for several cultivars of heirloom rice that have a naturally dark color.

The traditional recipe for this dish calls for squid ink, cuttlefish or squid, white rice, garlic, green cubanelle peppers, sweet paprika, olive oil and seafood broth. However, many cooks add other seafood as well, such as crab and shrimp.

The dish's dark color comes from squid ink which also enhances its seafood flavor.

In addition to Valencia and Catalonia, this dish is popular in Cuba and Puerto Rico where on both islands it is known as arroz con calamares ("rice with squid" in Spanish).

Fideuà negra ("black noodles" in Catalan) is a variation made with noodles instead of rice and is usually served with aioli.

## Fideuà



Fideuà (dialectal pronunciation of the Valencian/Catalan word fideuada "large amount of noodles") is a seafood dish originally from the coast of Valencia which is similar to paella, and even more to arròs a banda, but with noodles instead of rice. Its main ingredients are: pasta noodles (usually hollow), fish (rockfish, monkfish, cuttlefish, squid), and shellfish (Squilla mantis, shrimp, crayfish). It is seasoned mainly with lemon.





### History ##

The invention of fideuà is attributed to a picturesque story. Gabriel Rodriguez Pastor, (Gabrielo from a kiosk in the port district of Grau in Gandía), worked as a cook in a boat and Juan Bautista Pascual (Zábalo), was the youngest man in the boat and his assistant. According to Gabriel's family, the boat captain loved rice and the rest of sailors almost never received their full portion of arròs a banda, the dish that the cook usually prepared. Trying to find a solution for the problem, the cook had the idea of using noodles instead of rice to see if the result was a little less appetizing for the captain.

The invention was liked, and fame of the dish spread though harbor restaurants such as the "Pastaora House," where they cooked the first "fiduedades." The dish became distinctive and essential in the area.





### Characteristics ##

Just like paella, it is cooked in a special wide and flat frying pan, also called paella, although there are other traditional variants made in a casserole.

Gandia is the birthplace of fideuà, and in this city of La Safor region there is an annual competition-contest where the best cooks try to prepare the best fideuà.





### Curiosities ##

Currently, various skill competitions for chefs are done in preparing fideuá.

## Gata de Gorgos



Gata de Gorgos (Valencian: [ˈɡata ðe ˈɣoɾɣos], Spanish: [ˈɡata ðe ˈɣorɣos]) is a village in the Marina Alta region of the north Costa Blanca in Spain. It has a population of 5,325 (2005).

The village is known for its wicker industry and for having an unusually large number of bars and restaurants per capita. Boasting over 30 bars, the most popular are Ca Corder, which is located in the church square, and Ca Patrics, which is located in the Placa Nuevo.

The town's key fiestas take place during July to honour The Christ of the Calvary.(Fiestas en honor al Santísimo Cristo del Calvario). A key part of this event includes bull running along the street known as Paseo de Alicante - another is when the town's young men and women who are 'coming of age' form groups called 'Quintos' and march through the town accompanied by music and watched by family and friends. The highlight to many is the Paella Night, where most of the town congregate in the school to cook paella in the open air before being entertained by a local band.

## Valencian cuisine



Valencian cuisine is a Mediterranean cuisine as cooked in the Valencian Community, Spain. Its basic ingredients are vegetables, seafood and meat. It is famous worldwide for its rices, such as paella, and its citrus fruits. The cuisine of neighbouring regions have given and received important contributions from Valencian gastronomy, amongst them Balearic cuisine, Catalan cuisine, Aragonese cuisine, Manchego cuisine and Murcian cuisine.





### Main dishes ##



Paella. The most famous Valencian dish is one of the most recent. Although many towns claim to be the birthplace of paella, it is usually considered native to Albufera and Ribera, just south of Valencia. It can be found in two main varieties, with chicken and rabbit or with seafood. Nowadays paella can be found around the world and especially throughout Spain and Latin America. The name comes from the large pan ('paella' in Valencian) where it is cooked.

Arròs negre. Rice with squid and squid ink cooked in a paella.

Arròs al forn. A rice dish baked in the oven and usually containing sausages, chickpeas and potato amongst other ingredients, usually made with the surplus of the local typical stew.

Fideuà. A dish based on noodles and seafood, typical of the Valencian coast and originally from Gandia.

Arròs amb costra A kind of arròs al forn but covered with an egg which provides the "crust" in the name. It is typical of most of the south of Valencia and especially of Elche.

Gazpacho. A famous Spanish dish typical throughout south and central Spain. In the Valencia region it is typical of the southern and inland areas and is the quintessential summer dish.

Arròs a banda. A humble preparation typical of the Valencian coast with rice, fish, and sweet potato.

Embotits. Cured sausages.

Sobrassada a typically Majorcan meat-product which is produced in the Marina.

Bollit. Vegetable stew.

Suquet de peix. An eel, potato, garlic and fish stew, similar to Bouillabaisse.

All i pebre. a signature dish for the area around Valencia city and immediately to the south, containing peppers, garlic and potatoes with eels.

Espencat. Roasted vegetables, typically peppers and aubergine but other vegetables can be added.

Coques. Ancient local salty pastries with a common origin with Italian Pizza.





### Sauces ##

Allioli. This is a thick sauce, common to most of the Western Mediterranean, based on mixing garlic and olive oil to which egg is sometimes added. It usually has a characteristic yellow colour.

Mullador. A sauce whose ingredients may vary but always includes tomatoes. The remaining ingredients depend on the time of year and the vegetables available in each area. There are similar preparations throughout the Mediterranean. Other names for this kind of sauce are "samfaina" in Catalonia, "tomacat" or "tombet" in Majorca and ratatouille in France; much simpler is the "salsa napoletana" in Italy. In Alcoi and further south, this sauce may include tuna as is the case with "pisto", typical of Castile la Mancha.

Picada. This is a sauce composed of crushed nuts - usually almonds - olive oil, parsley and a little milk. It usually accompanies fish dishes.





### Sweets, apéritifs, desserts and drinks ##



Pestinyos. A small, sweet and dry pastry folded into three and flavoured with orange and aniseed.

Pastissets, a typical sweet made of pastry with a sweet almond or sweet potato filling. It is of probable Arab origin and is typical of most of Valencia and the south of Catalonia. A similar dish, called rubiols, is typical in Majorca.

Arnadí typical of Xàtiva

Coca (pastry). A kind of pizza or pie which can be either sweet or savoury. It is typical to most of Valencia as well as in the other territories of Catalan culture. The most common kinds in Valencia are the coca de llanda, a kind of sponge-cake, often pumpkin-, lemon- or apple-flavoured; coca de mullador - or coca de Sant Joan in Alicante - a small pizza-like pastry with ratatouille on top and occasionally tuna or other titbits; and coca de xulla, a flat bread with bacon and sausages on top. "Coca de molletes" typical of Alicante with soft salty flour crumbles.

Coques de dacsa, originally from Ròtova near Gandia and commercially available in the area around Denia and Gandia. These are flat pastry bases similar to Mexican tortillas, and topped with all kinds of titbits such as mullador. A similar preparation are coques de mestall, from the neighbouring county Valldigna.

Arrop i tallaetes. A dessert which immerses fruit pieces in a sweet syrup made from grape must.

Fartons. These are pastry fingers designed to be dipped in orxata.

Orxata (Horchata). A drink made from submerging rice or other products in water for long periods. There are at least two kinds made locally. The first is Orxata de Xufa, made with tigernuts, quintessentially Valencian and produced only in the area of Alboraya, just north of Valencia. The second is Orxata d'Ametlla, made and consumed in the Alicante and Xixona.

Peladillas (Jordan almonds). Typical from Casinos.

Torró. A kind of nougat, with strong tradition of Xixona and Alicante with, available in two styles, hard and soft.

Figues albardaes (a kind of fig fritter that are traditional in Falles)

Bunyols. Yet another Arab-inspired pastry, these are dough-balls which are fried and covered with sugar, which can be found in various parts of Mediterranean Spain such as Cadaqués, as well as in Madrid or even Latin America although in these cases they are not sweet. The Valencian variety habitually includes pumpkin in the dough, though often in commercial preparations this is not so. They are typical of Falles.





### Wines and liquors ##

Valencian wines are also well-regarded, with three Protected Designation of Origin: Alicante, Utiel-Requena and Valencia. In Utiel-Requena, champagne is made under the cava denomination. Meanwhile, muscat (known as "moscatell" also called "mistela") is produced in the Marina Alta (near Denia) under Alicante DO and also in Turís, Cheste, Godelleta and surroundings, under the Valencia DO.

## Finders Keepers (1966 film)



Finders Keepers is a 1966 British musical film directed by Sidney Hayers, written by Michael Pertwee and starring Cliff Richard. It was released in the U.S. the following year. A search was made to find an actress to play the Spanish girl who falls for Cliff. The 21-year-old Viviane Ventura won the role: born in London, but fluent in Spanish, she sang a spirited duet in the film with Cliff: Paella.





### Plot ##

Cliff and The Shadows travel to a Spanish town for a gig. When they arrive they are puzzled to find the area empty. They find out that a small bomb has accidentally been dropped on the town and the villagers have fled in panic that it will go off. The boys decide to find the bomb and restore peace in the village, with some musical numbers along the way.

## Arroz con pollo



Arroz con pollo (rice with chicken) is a traditional dish of Spain and Latin America, closely related to paella. In the Dominican Republic it is called locrio de pollo, and in Saint Martin it is called lokri or locreo.

There is some debate as to whether it originated in Spain. Puerto Ricans consider it one of their classic recipes. Many Puerto Ricans note that arroz con pollo cannot be made without beer and annatto oil and saffron is no substitute. Beer and annatto are rarely used in Spanish cooking and never in arroz con pollo there. Annatto is frequently used in Puerto Rican cooking especially in rice dishes like arroz con gandules (rice with pork and pigeon peas) and arroz con maiz (rice with corn and sausage). Beer is used in many Puerto Rican dishes like pollo guisado (braised stewed chicken) and asopao de pollo (chicken rice stew). Arroz con pollo and most Puerto Rican rice dishes are highly seasoned with sofrito, which is another key ingredient in arroz con pollo.

Food writer Elisabeth Lambert Ortiz, pointing out the international aspects of the dish, notes the origin of Arroz con Pollo in the Spanish forms of pilaf, already reflecting international influences: chicken was brought from India and rice from Asia; saffron (used for the yellow colour in Spain, instead of annatto) was introduced by Phoenician traders; tomatoes and peppers (also known as sofrito) are natives of the Americas.

## Arròs a banda



Arròs a banda (Valencian term for rice in a side, translated as Arroz a banda in Spanish) is a dish of rice cooked in fish stock, typical of the coastal area of Alicante (and, per extension, in most of Land of Valencia), Spain, and distinct from the paella of Valencia. It is popular up to Garraf, Barcelona (Catalonia) and down to Murcia (Region of Murcia).

It originated with the fishermen of Alicante, who sold off their best fish and kept the leftovers for stock, used to cook the rice. It is usually served with alioli.

## Jambalaya



Jambalaya (/ˌdʒʌmbəˈlaɪ.ə/ JUM-bə-LY-ə) is a Louisiana Creole dish of Spanish and French (especially Provençal) influence. It consists of meat and vegetables mixed with rice. Traditionally, the meat always includes sausage of some sort, often a smoked sausage such as Andouille, along with some other meat or seafood, frequently pork, chicken, crayfish, or shrimp. The vegetables are usually a sofrito-like mixture known as the "holy trinity" in Creole and Cajun cooking, consisting of onion, celery, and green bell pepper, though other vegetables such as carrots, tomatoes, chilis, and garlic are also used. After browning and sauteeing the meat and vegetables, rice, seasonings, and broth are added and the entire dish is cooked together until the rice is done.

Jambalaya is similar to (but distinct from) other rice-and-meat dishes known in Louisiana cuisine. Gumbo uses similar sausages, meats, seafood, vegetables and seasonings, however gumbo includes filé powder and okra, which are not common in jambalaya. Gumbo is also usually served over white rice, which is prepared separate from the rest of the dish, unlike jambalaya, where the rice is prepared with the other ingredients. Étouffée is a stew which always includes shellfish such as shrimp or crayfish, but does not have the sausage common to jambalaya and gumbo. Also, like gumbo, étouffée is usually served over separately prepared rice.

Jambalaya has its origins in several rice-based dishes well attested in the Mediterranean cuisines of Spain and France, especially in the Spanish dish paella (native to Valencia) and the French dish known as jambalaia (native to Provence). Other seasoned rice-based dishes from other cuisines include pilaf, risotto and Hoppin' John.





### Varieties ##



There are two primary methods of making jambalaya, differentiated by the presence or absence of tomatoes.

The first and most common is the city Creole jambalaya (also called "red jambalaya"). First, meat is added to the trinity of celery, peppers, and onions; the meat is usually chicken and sausage such as andouille or smoked sausage. Next vegetables and tomatoes are added to cook, followed by seafood. Rice and stock are added in equal proportions at the very end. The mixture is brought to a boil and left to simmer for 20 to 60 minutes, depending on the recipe, with infrequent stirring. Towards the end of the cooking process, stirring usually ceases. Some versions call for the jambalaya to be baked after the cooking of all the ingredients.

The second style, more characteristic of southwestern and south-central Louisiana, is rural Creole jambalaya, which contains no tomatoes (the idea being the farther away from New Orleans one gets, the less common tomatoes are in dishes). The meat is browned in a cast-iron pot. The bits of meat that stick to the bottom of the pot (sucs) are what give a rural jambalaya its brown color. A little vegetable oil is added if there is not enough fat in the pot. The trinity (of 50% onions, 25% celery, and 25% green or red bell pepper, although proportions can be altered to suit one's taste) is added and sautéed until soft. Stock and seasonings are added in the next step, and then the meats are returned to the pot. This mixture is then simmered, covered, for at least one hour. Lastly, the mixture is brought to a boil and rice is added to the pot. It is then covered and left to simmer over very low heat for at least 1/2 hour without stirring. The dish is finished when the rice has cooked.

A third method is less common, the "Cajun" jambalaya. In this version, meat and vegetables are cooked separately from the rice. At the same time, rice is cooked in a savory stock. It is added to the meat and vegetables before serving. This is called "white jambalaya." This dish is rare in Louisiana as it is seen as a "quick" attempt to make jambalaya, popularized outside the state to shorten cooking time.

Many people in the south, and typically in Louisiana, enjoy a simpler Jambalaya style. This style is cooked the same as the rural style, but there are no vegetables. Many restaurants serve this style as opposed to the others, because it is more child-friendly, has a more consistent texture, and is easier to make.

Jambalaya is considered by most Louisianans to be a filling but simple-to-prepare rice dish; gumbos, étouffées, and creoles are considered more difficult to perfect. Most often a long grain white rice is used in making jambalaya.

Jambalaya is differentiated from gumbo and étouffée by the way in which the rice is included. In these dishes, the rice is cooked separately and is served as a bed on which the main dish is served. In the usual method of preparing jambalaya, a rich stock is created from vegetables, meat, and seafood; raw rice is then added to the broth and the flavor is absorbed by the grains as the rice cooks.





### History ##



Creole jambalaya originates from the French Quarter of New Orleans, in the original European sector. It was an attempt by the Spanish to make paella in the New World, where saffron was not readily available due to import costs. Tomatoes became the substitute for saffron. As time went on, French influence became strong in New Orleans, and spices from the Caribbean changed this New World paella into a unique dish. In modern Louisiana, the dish has evolved along a variety of different lines. Creole jambalaya, or red jambalaya, is found primarily in and around New Orleans, where it is simply known as 'jambalaya'. City Creole jambalaya includes tomatoes, whereas rural jambalaya does not.

Rural Jambalaya originates from Louisiana's rural, low-lying swamp country where crawfish, shrimp, oysters, alligator, duck, turtle, boar, venison, nutria and other game were readily available. Any variety or combination of meats, including chicken or turkey may be used to make jambalaya. Rural jambalaya is known as 'Brown jambalaya' in the New Orleans area; to rural Creoles it is simply known as 'jambalaya.' Rural jambalaya has more of a smoky and spicy flavor than its cousin jambalaya. The French Creoles of couleur introduced jambalaya to the Cajuns.



The first appearance in print of any variant of the word 'jambalaya' in any language occurred in Leis amours de Vanus; vo, Lou paysan oou théâtré, by Fortuné (Fortunat) Chailan, first published in Provençal dialect in 1837. The earliest appearance of the word in print in English occurs in the May 1849 issue of the American Agriculturalist, page 161, where Solon Robinson refers to a recipe for 'Hopping Johnny (jambalaya)'. Jambalaya did not appear in a cookbook until 1878, when The Gulf City Cook Book, by the ladies of the St. Francis Street Methodist Episcopal Church, was printed in South Mobile, Alabama. It contains a recipe for "JAM BOLAYA".

Jambalaya experienced a brief jump in popularity during the 1920s and 1930s because of its flexible recipe. The dish was little more than the rice and vegetables the populace could afford, but the recipe grew from humble roots.

In 1968, Louisiana Governor John J. McKeithen proclaimed Gonzales, Louisiana, the Jambalaya Capital of the World. Every Spring, the annual Jambalaya Festival is held in Gonzales.





### Etymology ##

The Oxford English Dictionary indicates that 'jambalaya' comes from the Provençal word 'jambalaia', meaning a mish mash, or mixup, and also meaning a pilau (pilaf) of rice. This is supported by the fact that the first printed appearance of the word is in a Provençal poem published in 1837.



Another popular source suggests that the word comes from the Spanish 'jamón' ("ham") + 'paella', a noted Spanish rice dish. However, the evidence for this idea is also thin. Again, ham is not a featured element of the dish, and Spanish speakers would call a ham paella 'paella con jamón', not 'jamón paella.'

The Dictionary of American Food and Drink offers this creative old wives' tale about the origin of the word:



Late one evening a traveling gentleman stopped by a New Orleans inn which had little food remaining from the evening meal. The traveler instructed the cook, "Jean, balayez!" or "Jean, sweep something together!" in the local dialect. The guest pronounced the resulting hodge-podge dish as "Jean balayez."



The Atakapa tribe states the origin of the name. The original word "Sham, pal ha! Ya!" means "Be full, not skinny! Eat Up!" with a French equivalent of "Bon appétit!". Spanish influence resulted in the current spelling of the name.
