		PAELLA Paella -LRB- Catalan pronunciation : -LSB- paˈeʎa -RSB- or -LSB- pəˈeʎə -RSB- , Spanish : -LSB- paˈeʎa -RSB- ; English approximation : or -RRB- is a Valencian rice dish .

		Paella has ancient roots , but its modern form originated in the mid-19th century in the area around
Albufera	LOCATION	lagoon on the east coast of
Spain	LOCATION	, adjacent to the city of
Valencia	LOCATION	.

		Many non-Spaniards view paella as
Spain	LOCATION	's national dish , but most Spaniards consider it to be a regional Valencian dish .

		Valencians , in turn , regard paella as one of their identifying symbols .

		Types of paella include Valencian paella , vegetarian/vegan paella -LRB- Spanish : paella de verduras -RRB- , seafood paella -LRB- Spanish : paella de marisco -RRB- , and mixed paella -LRB- Spanish : paella mixta -RRB- , among many others .

		Valencian paella is believed to be the original recipe and consists of white rice , green beans -LRB- bajoqueta and tavella -RRB- , meat -LRB- chicken and rabbit -RRB- , white beans -LRB- garrofón -RRB- , snails , and seasoning such as saffron and rosemary .

		Another very common but seasonal ingredient is artichokes .

		Seafood paella replaces meat with seafood and omits beans and green vegetables .

		Mixed paella is a free-style combination of meat from land animals , seafood , vegetables , and sometimes beans .

		Most paella chefs use bomba rice due to it being less likely to overcook , but Valencians tend to use a slightly stickier -LRB- and thus more susceptible to overcooking -RRB- variety known as
Senia	PERSON	.

		All types of paellas use olive oil .

		Etymology Paella is a Valencian word which derives from the Old French word paelle for pan , which in turn comes from the Latin word patella for pan .

		The word paella is also related to paila used in many Latin American countries .

		Paila in the Spanish language of
Latin America	LOCATION	refers to a variety of cookware resembling metal and clay pans , which are also used for both cooking and serving .

		The Latin root patella from which paella derives is also akin to the modern French poêle , the Italian padella and the Old Spanish padilla .

		Valencians use the word paella for all pans in the Valencian language , including the specialized shallow pan used for cooking paellas .

		However , in most other parts of
Spain	LOCATION	and throughout Hispanic
America	LOCATION	where the Spanish language is spoken -LRB- as opposed to the Valencian language -RRB- , the term paellera -LRB- `` paella pan '' -RRB- is more commonly used for the specialised pan while paella is reserved for the rice dish prepared in it , although both terms are deemed correct for the pan , as stated by the
Royal Spanish Academy	ORGANIZATION	, the body responsible for regulating the Spanish language in
Spain	LOCATION	.

		Paelleras are traditionally round , shallow , and made of polished steel with two handles .

		History Possible origins Moors in Muslim
Spain	LOCATION	began rice cultivation around the 10th century .

		Consequently , Valencians often made casseroles of rice , fish , and spices for family gatherings and religious feasts , thus establishing the custom of eating rice in
Spain	LOCATION	.

		This led to rice becoming a staple by the 15th century .

		Afterwards , it became customary for cooks to combine rice with vegetables , beans , and dry cod , providing an acceptable meal for Lent .

		Along
Spain	LOCATION	's eastern coast , rice was predominantly eaten with fish .

		Spanish food historian
Lourdes	PERSON	March notes that the dish `` symbolizes the union and heritage of two important cultures , the Roman , which gives us the utensil and the Arab which brought us the basic food of humanity for centuries . ''

		Valencian paella On special occasions , 18th century Valencians used calderos to cook rice in the open air of their orchards near lake
Albufera	LOCATION	.

		Water vole meat was one of the main ingredients of early paellas , along with eel and butter beans .

		Novelist
Vicente Blasco Ibáñez	PERSON	described the Valencian custom of eating water voles in
Cañas	LOCATION	y Barro -LRB- 1902 -RRB- , a realistic novel about life among the fishermen and peasants near lake
Albufera	LOCATION	.

		Living standards rose with the sociological changes of the late 19th century in
Spain	LOCATION	, giving rise to gatherings and outings in the countryside .

		This led to a change in paella 's ingredients , as well , using instead rabbit , chicken , duck and sometimes snails .

		This dish became so popular that in 1840 , a local Spanish newspaper first used the word paella to refer to the recipe rather than the pan .

		The most widely used , complete ingredient list of this era was : short-grain white rice , chicken , rabbit , snails -LRB- optional -RRB- , duck -LRB- optional -RRB- , butter beans , great northern beans , runner beans , artichoke -LRB- a substitute for runner beans in the winter -RRB- , tomatoes , fresh rosemary , sweet paprika , saffron , garlic -LRB- optional -RRB- , salt , olive oil , and water .

		Poorer Valencians , however , sometimes used nothing more than snails for meat .

		Valencians insist that only these ingredients should go into making modern Valencian paella .

		Seafood and mixed paella On the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	coast , Valencians used seafood instead of meat and beans to make paella .

		Valencians regard this recipe as authentic , as well .

		In this recipe , the seafood is served in the shell .

		A variant on this is paella del senyoret which uses seafood without shells .

		Later , however , Spaniards living outside of
Valencia	LOCATION	combined seafood with meat from land animals and mixed paella was born .

		This paella is sometimes called preparación barroca -LRB- baroque preparation -RRB- due to the variety of ingredients and its final presentation .

		During the 20th century , paella 's popularity spread past
Spain	LOCATION	's borders .

		As other cultures set out to make paella , the dish invariably acquired regional influences .

		Consequently , paella recipes went from being relatively simple to including a wide variety of seafood , meat , sausage -LRB- including chorizo -RRB- , vegetables and many different seasonings .

		However , the most globally popular recipe is seafood paella .

		Throughout non-Valencian
Spain	LOCATION	, mixed paella is very popular .

		Some restaurants in
Spain	LOCATION	-LRB- and many in the
United States	LOCATION	-RRB- that serve this mixed version refer to it as Valencian paella .

		However , Valencians insist that only the original two Valencian recipes are authentic , and generally view all others as inferior , not genuine , or even grotesque .

		Basic cooking methods According to tradition in
Valencia	LOCATION	, paella is cooked over an open fire , fueled by orange and pine branches along with pine cones .

		This produces an aromatic smoke which infuses the paella .

		Also , dinner guests traditionally eat directly out of the paellera .

		Some recipes call for paella to be covered and left to settle for five to ten minutes after cooking .

		Valencian paella This recipe is standardized because Valencians consider it traditional and very much part of their culture .

		Rice in Valencian paella is never braised in oil , as pilaf , though the paella made further southwest of
Valencia	LOCATION	often is .

		Heat oil in a paella .

		Sauté meat after seasoning with salt .

		Add green vegetables and sauté until soft .

		Add garlic -LRB- optional -RRB- , grated tomatoes , beans and sauté .

		Add paprika and sauté .

		Add water , saffron -LRB- or food coloring -RRB- , snails -LRB- optional -RRB- and rosemary .

		Boil to make broth and allow it to reduce by half .

		Remove the rosemary once flavour has infused or it starts to fall apart .

		Add rice and simmer until rice is cooked .

		Garnish with more fresh rosemary .

		Seafood paella Recipes for this dish vary somewhat , even in
Valencia	LOCATION	.

		The recipe below is based on the two cited here .

		Make a seafood broth from shrimp heads , onions , garlic and bay leaves .

		Heat oil in a paellera .

		Add mussels .


Cook	PERSON	until they open and then remove .

		Sauté
Norway	LOCATION	lobster and whole , deep-water rose shrimp .

		Then remove both the lobster and shrimp .

		Add chopped cuttlefish and sauté .

		Add shrimp tails and sauté .

		Add garlic and sauté .

		Add grated tomato and sauté .

		Add rice and braise in sofrito .

		Add paprika and sauté .

		Add seafood broth and then saffron -LRB- or food coloring -RRB- .

		Add salt to taste .

		Add the deep-water rose shrimp , mussels and
Norway	LOCATION	lobster that were set aside .

		Simmer until rice is cooked .

		Mixed paella There are countless mixed paella recipes .

		The following method is common to most of these .

		Seasoning depends greatly on individual preferences and regional influences .

		However , salt , saffron and garlic are almost always included .

		Make a broth from seafood , chicken , onions , garlic , bell peppers and bay leaf .

		Heat oil in a paellera .

		Sear red bell pepper strips and set aside .

		Sear crustaceans and set aside .

		Season meat lightly with salt and sauté meat until golden brown .

		Add onions , garlic and bell peppers .

		Sauté until vegetables are tender .

		Add grated tomatoes and sauté .

		Add dry seasonings except for salt .

		Add rice .

		Braise rice until covered with sofrito .

		Add broth .

		Add salt to taste .

		Simmer until rice is almost cooked .

		Re-place crustaceans .

		Continue simmering until rice and crustaceans are finished cooking .

		Garnish with seared red bell pepper strips .

		For all recipes After cooking paella , there is usually a layer of toasted rice at the bottom of the pan , called socarrat in
Spain	LOCATION	.

		This is considered a delicacy among Spaniards and is essential to a good paella .

		The toasted rice develops on its own if the paella is cooked over a burner or open fire .

		If cooked in an oven , however , it will not .

		To correct this , place the paellera over a high flame while listening to the rice toast at the bottom of the pan .

		Once the aroma of toasted rice wafts upwards , it is removed from the heat .

		The paella must then sit for about five minutes -LRB- most recipes recommend the paella be covered with a tea-towel at this point -RRB- to absorb the remaining broth .

		Competitions and records It has become a custom at mass gatherings in the Valencian Community -LRB- festivals , political campaigns , protests , etc. -RRB- to prepare enormous paellas , sometimes to win mention in the Guinness Book of World Records .

		Chefs use gargantuan paelleras for these events .

		Valencian restaurateur
Juan Galbis	PERSON	claims to have made the world 's largest paella with help from a team of workers on 2 October 2001 .

		This paella fed about 110,000 people according to
Galbis	PERSON	' former website .


Galbis	PERSON	says this paella was even larger than his earlier world-record paella made on 8 March 1992 which fed about 100,000 people .


Galbis	PERSON	's record-breaking 1992 paella is listed in Guinness World Records .

		Controversy Many chefs around the world have taken the traditional dish and added ingredients , such as chorizo , that are considered not to belong in the dish by Valencians .

		Spaniards , especially people from
Valencia	LOCATION	, have complained about this many times and it is a recurrent topic online .

		The alternative name proposed for these dishes , although pejorative , is `` Arroz con cosas '' -LRB- rice with things -RRB- .

		Famous cases are
Jamie Oliver	PERSON	's paella recipe and
Gordon Ramsay	PERSON	.

		The author
Josep Pla	PERSON	once noted : The abuses committed in the name of
Paella Valenciana	LOCATION	, are excessive - an absolute scandal .

		Similar dishes Traditional Valencian cuisine offers recipes similar to paella valenciana and paella de marisco such as arròs negre , arròs al forn , arròs a banda and arròs amb fesols i naps .

		Fideuà is a noodle dish variation of the paella cooked in a similar fashion , though it may be served with allioli sauce .
