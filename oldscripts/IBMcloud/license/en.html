International License Agreement for Early Release of 
Programs<br>
<br>
Part 1 - General Terms<br>
<br>
THIS INTERNATIONAL LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR EARLY RELEASE OF 
PROGRAMS ("AGREEMENT") IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND IBM. BY 
DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, OR USING THE PROGRAM YOU 
AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE 
TERMS ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PERSON OR A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL 
ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO 
BIND THAT PERSON, COMPANY, OR LEGAL ENTITY TO THESE TERMS.<br>
<br>
"Early Release" is a release of a Program that (1) may 
still be under development (and therefore, is potentially 
unreliable) or (2) may no longer be under development but has not been 
made commercially available to users.<br>
<br>
"IBM" is International Business Machines Corporation or one 
of its subsidiaries.<br>
<br>
"License Information" ("LI") is a document that provides 
information and terms specific to a Program. The Program's LI is 
available in a file in the Program's directory, by the use of a 
system command, or as a booklet that accompanies the Program.<br>
<br>
"Program" is one or more of the following, including the 
original and all whole or partial copies: 1) machine-readable 
instructions and data, 2) human readable software components, 3) audio-
visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), 4) 
related licensed materials, 5) license use documents or keys, (6) 
associated documentation, and (7) any enhancements, updates  or 
materials that IBM may elect in its discretion to provide to You as 
Support (as described below).<br>
<br>
"You" and "Your" refer either to an individual person or to 
a single legal entity.<br>
<br>
This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - 
Country-unique Terms (if any), and License Information and is the 
complete agreement between You and IBM regarding the use of the 
Program. It replaces any prior oral or written communications 
between You and IBM concerning Your use of the Program. The terms 
of Part 2 and the License Information may replace or modify 
those of Part 1.<br>
<br>
1. License<br>
<br>
The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is 
copyrighted and licensed, not sold.<br>
<br>
IBM grants You a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable 
license to download, install, and use the Program during the 
evaluation period solely for internal testing and evaluation purposes 
and to provide feedback to IBM.<br>
<br>
You may make a backup copy of the Program to support such 
use.  You are not authorized to use the Program for productive 
purposes or to distribute the Program or any of its parts.  You may 
not modify or create derivative works of the Program.  The 
terms of this license apply to each copy that You make. You must 
reproduce all copyright notices and all other legends of ownership on 
each copy, or partial copy, of the Program.<br>
<br>
You will 1) maintain a record of any copies of the Program 
and 2) ensure that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either 
locally or remotely) does so only for Your authorized use, and 
complies with the terms of this Agreement.<br>
<br>
You may not: 1) use, copy, modify, transfer or distribute 
the Program except as provided in this Agreement; 2) reverse 
assemble, reverse compile, or otherwise translate the Program into 
human-readable form or into another program language (except as 
may be specifically permitted by law without the possibility of 
contractual waiver); 3) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program; or 4) 
use the Program on a service-bureau basis.<br>
<br>
This license does not entitle You to receive from IBM hard-
copy documentation, support, telephone assistance, or 
enhancements or updates to the Program (collectively, "Support"), 
although IBM, at its sole discretion may choose to provide such 
Support.  Any enhancements, updates and other materials provided by 
IBM as part of Support are considered to be part of the Program 
and therefore governed by this Agreement.<br>
<br>
THE PROGRAM MAY CONTAIN A DISABLING DEVICE THAT WILL 
PREVENT IT FROM BEING USED AFTER THE EVALUATION PERIOD ENDS. YOU 
MAY NOT TAMPER WITH THIS DISABLING DEVICE OR THE PROGRAM. YOU 
SHOULD TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT MIGHT 
RESULT WHEN THE PROGRAM CAN NO LONGER BE USED.<br>
<br>
2. Term<br>
<br>
The evaluation period begins when You agree to the terms of 
this Agreement and ends upon the earliest of 1) the end date (if 
any) specified in the License Information, 2) the date on which 
the Program automatically disables itself, or 3) the date on 
which IBM makes the program commercially available.  Your license 
to the Program terminates at the end of the evaluation period, 
and You will destroy the Program and all copies made of it 
within 10 days of the end of the evaluation period.<br>
<br>
There is no charge for Your use of the Program for the 
duration of the evaluation period.<br>
<br>
IBM may terminate Your license if You fail to comply with 
the terms of this Agreement. If IBM does so, You must destroy 
all copies of the Program.<br>
<br>
3. Rights In Data<br>
<br>
You assign to IBM all right, title, and interest (including 
ownership of copyright) in any data, suggestions, or written 
materials that 1) are related to the Program and 2) You provide to 
IBM.  If IBM requires it, You will sign an appropriate document 
to assign such rights.  To the extent not otherwise covered by 
your grant under the first sentence of this Section 3, with 
respect to any idea, know-how, concept, technique, invention, 
discovery or improvement, whether or not patentable, related to the 
Program and that you provide to IBM, You grant to IBM a non-
exclusive, irrevocable, unrestricted, worldwide and paid-up right and 
license to include the foregoing in any product or service, and to 
use, manufacture and market any such product or service, and to 
allow others to do any of the foregoing.<br>
<br>
4. No Warranty<br>
<br>
SUBJECT TO STATUTORY WARRANTIES, IF ANY, THAT CANNOT BE 
EXCLUDED, IBM MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND WARRANTIES OF TITLE AND NON-
INFRINGEMENT, REGARDING THE PROGRAM OR TECHNICAL SUPPORT, IF ANY.<br>
<br>
The exclusion also applies to any of IBM's Program 
developers and suppliers.<br>
<br>
Manufacturers, suppliers, or publishers of non-IBM Programs 
may provide their own warranties.<br>
<br>
5. Limitation of Liability<br>
<br>
Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on 
IBM's part or other liability, You are entitled to recover 
damages from IBM. Regardless of the basis on which You may be 
entitled to claim damages from IBM, (including fundamental breach, 
negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract or tort claim), IBM is 
liable for no more than 1) damages for bodily injury (including 
death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property 
and 2) the amount of any other actual direct damages up to a 
total of U.S. $25,000 (or equivalent in local currency) for all 
claims in the aggregate.  This limitation of liability also 
applies to IBM's Program developers and suppliers. It is the 
maximum for which they and IBM are collectively responsible.<br>

respect to the Program that violates applicable export control laws.<br>
4. You agree to allow International Business Machines

relationship; and may be provided to contractors acting on IBM's behalf, 
IBM Business Partners who promote, market, and support certain 
IBM products and services, and assignees of International 
Business Machines Corporation and its subsidiaries, for uses 
consistent with such business relationship.<br>
5. IBM does not warrant that any version of the Program 
that is formally released or made commercially available (if 
any) will be similar to, or compatible with, Early Release 
versions.<br>
6. Neither You nor IBM will bring a legal action under this 
Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose unless 
otherwise provided by local law without the possibility of 
contractual waiver or limitation.<br>
7. Neither You nor IBM is responsible for failure to 
fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control.<br>

action for any third party, nor will IBM be responsible for any 
third party claims against You except, as permitted by the

death) or damage to real or tangible personal property for which 
IBM is legally liable.<br>
