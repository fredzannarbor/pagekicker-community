The interest of the United States in the <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Hawaiian_Islands" title="Hawaiian Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a> followed its whaling and trading ships in the Pacific. As early as 1820, an "Agent of the United States for Commerce and Seamen" was appointed to look after American business in the <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Port_of_Honolulu" title="Port of Honolulu" class="mw-redirect">Port of Honolulu</a>.

When Percival's ship, <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/USS_Dolphin_(1821)" title="USS Dolphin (1821)"><i>Dolphin</i></a>, arrived in Honolulu, an ordinance inspired by the missionaries, placed restrictions on alcoholic liquors and the taking of women aboard vessels in the Honolulu Harbor. <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Lieutenant" title="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</a> Percival and members of his crew felt that the new vice laws were unfair and, with more than a mere threat of force, had them rescinded. This action was later renounced by the United States and resulted in the sending of an envoy to King <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Kauikeaouli" title="Kauikeaouli" class="mw-redirect">Kauikeaouli</a>. When Captain <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Thomas_ap_Catesby_Jones" title="Thomas ap Catesby Jones">Thomas ap Catesby Jones</a>  arrived, in command of the <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/USS_Peacock_(1813)" title="USS Peacock (1813)"><i>Peacock</i></a>, he was the first naval officer to visit Hawaii armed with instructions to discuss international affairs with the Hawaii King and Chiefs and to conclude a trade treaty.
</p><p>Throughout the 1820s and 1830s, many American warships visited Honolulu. In most cases, the commanding officers carried letters from the U.S. Government giving advice on governmental affairs and of the relations of the island nation with foreign powers. In 1841, the newspaper <i>Polynesian</i>, printed in Honolulu, advocated that the U.S. establish a naval base in Hawaii. Its pretext was protection of American citizens engaged in the whaling industry. The British Hawaiian Minister of Foreign Affairs <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Robert_Crichton_Wyllie" title="Robert Crichton Wyllie">Robert Crichton Wyllie</a>, remarked in 1840 that "...my opinion is that the tide of events rushes on to annexation to the United States." This trend was helped by incidents with the British and French. On February 13, 1843, Lord <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/George_Paulet_(Royal_Navy_officer)" title="George Paulet (Royal Navy officer)" class="mw-redirect">George Paulet</a>, of <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/HMS_Carysfort_(1836)" title="HMS Carysfort (1836)">HMS&nbsp;<i>Carysfort</i></a> occupied the islands in an incident known as the <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Paulet_Affair_(1843)" title="Paulet Affair (1843)">Paulet Affair</a>. Although an American warship, <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/USS_Boston_(1825)" title="USS Boston (1825)"><i>Boston</i></a>, was in the harbor, its commanding officer did not interfere. Official protest was made a few days later, however, by Commodore Kearney of <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/USS_Constellation_(1797)" title="USS Constellation (1797)"><i>Constellation</i></a>. The actions of Lord Paulet were disavowed by <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/George_Hamilton-Gordon,_4th_Earl_of_Aberdeen" title="George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen">Lord Aberdeen</a> in London. France and Britain recognized Hawaiian independence, but the United States declined.
</p><p>After France agitated again in the 1849 <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/French_Invasion_of_Honolulu" title="French Invasion of Honolulu" class="mw-redirect">invasion</a>, King <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Kamehameha_III" title="Kamehameha III">Kamehameha III</a>, under the influence of his American advisors, drew up a deed of cessation to the United States. The commanding officer of <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/USS_Vandalia_(1828)" title="USS Vandalia (1828)"><i>Vandalia</i></a> had his ship stand by while awaiting Washington's reply. With the death of the king, the retirement of the French forces, and the foreign policy of the <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Millard_Fillmore" title="Millard Fillmore">Fillmore</a> administration, the cessation idea fell into disfavor. The Navy Department received orders, however, to keep the naval armament of the U.S. in the Pacific.
</p><p>With the conclusion of the <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a>, the purchase of <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>, the increased importance of the Pacific states, the projected trade with the Orient and the desire for a duty free market for Hawaiian staples, Hawaiian trade expanded. In 1865, the North Pacific Squadron was formed to embrace the western coast and Hawaii. <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/USS_Lackawanna_(1862)" title="USS Lackawanna (1862)"><i>Lackawanna</i></a> in the following year was assigned to cruise among the islands, "a locality of great and increasing interest and importance." This vessel surveyed the <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Northwestern_Hawaiian_Islands" title="Northwestern Hawaiian Islands">Northwestern Hawaiian Islands</a> toward Japan. As a result the United States claimed <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Midway_Atoll" title="Midway Atoll">Midway Island</a>. The Secretary of the Navy was able to write in his annual report of 1868, that in November, 1867, 42 American flags flew over whaleships and merchant vessels in Honolulu to only six of other nations. This increased activity caused the permanent assignment of at least one warship to Hawaiian waters. It also praised Midway Island as possessing a harbor surpassing Honolulu's. In the following year, Congress approved an appropriation of $50,000 on March 1, 1869, to deepen the approaches to this harbor.
</p><p>After 1868, when the Commander of the Pacific Fleet visited the islands to look after "American interests," naval officers played an important role in internal affairs. They served as arbitrators in business disputes, negotiators of trade agreements and defenders of law and order. Periodic voyages among the islands and to the mainland aboard U.S. warships were arranged for members of the Hawaiian royal family and important island government officials. When King <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Lunalilo" title="Lunalilo">Lunalilo</a> died in 1873, negotiations were underway for the cessation of Pearl Harbor as a port for the duty-free export of sugar to the U.S. With the election of King <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Kal%C4%81kaua" title="KalÄ�kaua">KalÄ�kaua</a> in March, 1874, riots prompted landing of <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Bluejacket" title="Bluejacket">bluejackets</a> from USS <i>Tuscorora</i> and <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/USS_Portsmouth_(1843)" title="USS Portsmouth (1843)"><i>Portsmouth</i></a>. The British warship, <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=HMS_Tenedos_(1870)&action=edit&redlink=1" class="new" title="HMS Tenedos (1870) (page does not exist)">HMS&nbsp;<i>Tenedos</i></a>, also landed a token force. During the reign of King KalÄ�kaua the United States was granted exclusive rights to enter Pearl Harbor and to establish "a coaling and repair station."
</p><p>This treaty continued in force until August 1898, the U.S. did not fortify Pearl Harbor as a naval base. The shallow entrance constituted a formidable barrier against the use of the deep protected waters of the inner harbor as it had for 60 years.

The <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Spanish-American_War" title="Spanish-American War" class="mw-redirect">Spanish-American War</a> of 1898 and the desire for the United States to have a permanent presence in the Pacific both contributed to the decision.
</p><h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Pearl_Harbor&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: 1899â€“1941">edit</a>]</span><span class="mw-headline" id="1899.E2.80.931941">1899â€“1941</span></h3><p>Following the <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Overthrow_of_the_Hawaiian_Kingdom#The_annexation_of_Hawaii" title="Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom" class="mw-redirect">annexation</a>, Pearl Harbor was refitted to allow for more navy ships. In May 1899, <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Commander_(United_States)" title="Commander (United States)">Commander</a> F. Merry was made naval representative with authority to transact business for the Navy Department and its <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/United_States_Navy_bureau_system" title="United States Navy bureau system">Bureaus</a>. He immediately assumed control of the Coal Depot and its equipment. To supplement his facilities, he was assigned the Navy tug <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/USS_Iroquois_(AT-46)" title="USS Iroquois (AT-46)"><i>Iroquois</i></a> and two coal barges. Inquiries that commenced in June culminated in the establishment of the "Naval Station, Honolulu" on November 17, 1899. On February 2, 1900, this title was changed to "Naval Station, Hawaii."
</p><p>The creation of the Naval Station allowed the Navy Department to explore territorial outposts. In October 1899, <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/USS_Nero_(AC-17)" title="USS Nero (AC-17)"><i>Nero</i></a> and <i>Iroquois</i> made extensive surveys and sounding of the waterways to Midway and <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Guam" title="Guam">Guam</a>. One of the reasons for these explorations was to select a possible cable route to <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Luzon" title="Luzon">Luzon</a>.
</p><p>A coal famine and an outbreak of the <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Bubonic_plague" title="Bubonic plague">bubonic plague</a> were the only two incidents that hindered the Commandant from fulfilling his primary functions. Because of the severe coal shortage in September 1899, the Commandant sold coal to the <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Oahu_Railway_and_Land_Company" title="Oahu Railway and Land Company">Oahu Railway and Land Company</a> and the <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Inter-Island_Steam_Navigation_Company" title="Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company">Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company</a>, Ltd. Although this indicated the affinity of economic ties with the Navy, it was to a certain extent counteracted by the quarantine of the naval establishment from December 1899-February 1900, because of the bubonic plague. Approximately 61 deaths were recorded in Honolulu for this period. Work was consequently delayed on nascent Navy projects in Honolulu Harbor.
</p><p>From 1900-1908, the Navy devoted its time to improving the facilities of the 85 <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Acre" title="Acre">acres</a> (34&nbsp;<a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Hectare" title="Hectare">ha</a>) that constituted the naval reservation in Honolulu. Under the Appropriation Act of March 3, 1901, this tract of land was improved with the erection of additional sheds and housing. Improvements included a machine shop, smithery and foundry, Commandant's house and stables, cottage for the watchman, fencing, 10-ton wharf crane, and water-pipe system. The harbor was dredged and the channel enlarged to accommodate larger ships. On May 28, 1903, the first battleship, <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/USS_Wisconsin_(BB-9)" title="USS Wisconsin (BB-9)"><i>Wisconsin</i></a>, entered the harbor for coal and water. However, when the vessels of the Asiatic station visited Honolulu in January 1904, <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Rear_Admiral_(United_States)" title="Rear Admiral (United States)" class="mw-redirect">Rear Admiral</a><a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Silas_Terry&action=edit&redlink=1" class="new" title="Silas Terry (page does not exist)">Silas Terry</a> complained that they were inadequately accommodated with dockage and water.
</p><p>Under the above Appropriation Act, Congress approved the acquisition of lands for the development of a naval station at Pearl Harbor and the improvement of the channel to the Lochs. The Commandant, under the direction of the <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Bureau_of_Equipment_and_Recruiting&action=edit&redlink=1" class="new" title="Bureau of Equipment and Recruiting (page does not exist)">Bureau of Equipment</a>, attempted to obtain options on lands surrounding Pearl Harbor that were recommended for naval use. This endeavor was unsuccessful when the owners of the property refused to accept what was deemed to be a fair price. Condemnation proceedings, under the Hawaiian law of eminent domain, were begun on July 6, 1901. The land acquired by this suit included the present Navy Yard, <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Kauhua_Island&action=edit&redlink=1" class="new" title="Kauhua Island (page does not exist)">Kauhua Island</a>, and a strip on the southeast coast of <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Ford_Island" title="Ford Island">Ford Island</a>. The work of dredging the coral reef that blocked Pearl Harbor progressed rapidly enough to allow the gunboat <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/USS_Petrel_(PG-2)" title="USS Petrel (PG-2)"><i>Petrel</i></a> to proceed to the upper part of Main Loch in January 1905.
</p><p>One of the early concerns of the growing station was that the Army would make claims on its property. Because of their facilities, as wharves, cranes, artesian wells, and coal supplies, many requests were made by the Army for their use. By February 1901, the Army had made application for the privilege of establishing on Navy docks movable cranes for handling coal and other stores, a saluting battery and a flag staff on the naval reservation, and an artesian well of its own. All these requests were rejected by the Bureau of Equipment on the theory that, once granted, they "will practically constitute a permanent foothold on the property, and end in dividing it between the two Departments, or in the entire exclusion of the Navy Department on the ground of military expediency as established by frequency of use." However, the Army Depot Quartermaster at Honolulu contracted for the sinking of an artesian well on the Naval Station with the Commandant's approval, who, in turn, acted on a recommendation of the <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Bureau_of_Yards_and_Docks" title="Bureau of Yards and Docks">Bureau of Yards and Docks</a>. The flow of water obtained amounted to over 1.5 million gallons per day, sufficient for all purposes of the Army and Navy. The Bureau of Equipment felt that its word of caution was justified when the Depot Quartermaster in 1902 let it be known that any water used by the Navy from the artesian well was "only given by courtesy of the Army."
</p><p>Despite the warnings of the Bureau of Equipment, the <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/United_States_Department_of_War" title="United States Department of War">War Department</a>, the <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Department_of_Labor_and_Commerce" title="Department of Labor and Commerce" class="mw-redirect">Department of Labor and Commerce</a>, and the <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture" title="United States Department of Agriculture">Department of Agriculture</a> had secured permission to settle on the naval reservation. By 1906, the Commandant believed that it was necessary for the Bureau of Yards and Docks to develop a policy on the future of the station. The docks were being used to a greater extent by the Army transports, than by Navy ships, and the Army was actually attempting to get possession of Quarantine Wharf (which was built by the Territorial Government on the Naval Reservation, with the understanding that it could be taken over at any time by the Navy Department upon the payment of its appraised value.) In 1903, the Department of Labor and Commerce received about 7 acres (2.8&nbsp;ha) for an Immigration Station. The Department of Agriculture had, in the meanwhile, secured part of the site intended for a hospital as an experimental station. The Commandant felt that, if the station was going to develop beyond a mere coaling depot, these territorial encroachments on the part of other departments should be stopped, particularly when they were enjoying the benefits of naval appropriations. "On the other hand," he wrote, "if it is the intention to improve Pearl Harbor and eventually abandon this station every effort should be made to begin work there as soon as possible. . . . I am informed that important commercial interests will make a strong effort next year to have Pearl Harbor improved, and I think that will be an opportune time for the Navy Department to make efforts in the same direction."
</p><p>In 1908, the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard was established. The period from 1908-1919 was one of steady and continuous growth of the Naval Station, Pearl Harbor, with the exception of the discouraging collapse of the <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Drydock" title="Drydock">drydock</a> in 1913. The Act of May 13, 1908 authorized the enlargement and dredging of the Pearl Harbor channel and lochs "to admit the largest ships," the building of shops and supply houses for the Navy Yard, and the construction of a drydock. Work on the dock started on September 21, 1909. In April 1910, the barquentine <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Amaranth_(barquentine)" title="Amaranth (barquentine)"><i>Amaranth</i></a> became the fourth deep-sea, cargo-carrying vessel to venture into the newly dredged harbor, having been preceded by the three-masted schooner <i>W.H. Marston</i> on March 8, and the schooner <i>Ariel</i> and bark <i>Marston</i> a few days later. <i>Amaranth</i> delivered materials for construction of the dry dock facility.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/extract?url=http%3A%2F%2Fzimzazbiz3.bitnamiapp.com%2Fsfb%2Fscripts%2FIBMcloud%2Ffoo.html&extractor=ArticleExtractor&output=htmlFragment#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Work progressed satisfactorily on all projects, except the drydock. After much wrangling with Congress to secure an appropriation of over three million dollars for its construction, the drydock was wrecked by "underground pressure." "On February 17, 1913, the entire drydock structure rumbled, rocked, and caved in." The drydock was ceremonially opened to flooding on August 21, 1919, by Mrs. <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Josephus_Daniels" title="Josephus Daniels">Josephus Daniels</a>, wife of the Secretary of the Navy.  In 1917, <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Ford_Island" title="Ford Island">Ford Island</a> in the middle of Pearl Harbor was purchased for joint Army and Navy use in the development of military aviation in the Pacific.
</p><p>As the <a href="http://boilerpipe-web.appspot.com/mediawiki/index.php/Japanese_military" title="Japanese military" class="mw-redirect">Japanese military</a> pressed its war in China, concern over Japan's intentions caused the U.S. to begin taking defensive measures. On February 1, 1933, the U.S. Navy staged a mock attack on the base at Pearl Harbor as part of a preparedness exercise.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_needed" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from November 2009">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The attack "succeeded" and the defense was deemed a "failure".
