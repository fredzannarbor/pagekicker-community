## Search Engine Registries in PageKicker

Search engine registry files contain a list of search engine(s) that the *builder.sh* program will use when it builds a book.

By default, the system searches only a single search engine, the public Wikipedia.  The default registry file resides at conf/jobprofiles/search_engines/default.csv.
