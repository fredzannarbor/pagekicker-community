The Executive Summary serves as a starting point – but also the end point – for the policy paper. It telegraphs your key recommendations, relying on your authority as a researcher or expert in your field. It not only summarizes your key points for the busy reader, but highlights the recommendations in a memorable way to guide future discussions. Think of it through the lens of your decision maker: What key points best prepare your decision maker to remember and understand your research and recommendations?
As a general rule, the executive summary is no more than 5% of the full length of the paper, so a 100-page white paper might have a 5-page executive summary. This is merely a rule of thumb. Your executive summary should be as long as it needs to be to summarize your key points.
1) Motivation/problem statement: Why do we care about the problem? What practical, theoretical, legal, sociological, or policy gap does your research address? How does your work contribute to the field? How does it intersect—or not—with other scholars work in the field?
2) Methods/procedure/approach: What did you do to get your results? What methods did you use—e.g., developed and analyzed surveys, completed a series of multivariate regressions, analyzed the legislative history of the issue, interviewed stakeholders, etc.
3) Results/findings/recommendations: As a result of your analysis, what did you learn/recommend?
4) Conclusions/implications: What are the larger implications of your findings? How do they help readers understand the problem? How do they help decision makers understand/solve the problem? How do they help identify the gap in existing research? Are there next steps in pursuing research on the issue?
A useful way to draft your introduction is the journalist’s “Who / What / Why / How” heuristic
