# pagekicker-community
Algorithmic book creation: push a button, build a unique new e-book using permissioned content.

PageKicker accepts explicit or implicit user specifications, searches permissioned content, fetches it, analyzes, designs, assembles, converts, and distributes the results in ebook, web, document, or mobile format.

The github wiki https://github.com/fredzannarbor/pagekicker-community/wiki is the primary mechanism for communicating project roadmap and vision.
