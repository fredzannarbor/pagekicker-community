NOTES FOR INSTALL DOCUMENTATION

MYSQL must be installed and running.  The MYSQL database name, user id, and password are all set in conf/config.txt.

Use the Bitnami LAMP or MAMP (mac) stacks at http://bitnami.com/stack/mamp or http://bitnami.com/stack/lamp.


APT-GET INSTALLATIONS

        Use script to install same set of packages as currently on PageKicker home.

        sudo apt-get install libio-socket-ssl-perl libnet-ssleay-perl is required for sendemail to work.


IMAGEMAGICK REQUIREMENTS

	Version 6.8.9 or higher.

	You must move conf/colors.xml to the imagemagick configuration directory, which is ~/.magick in my system

	You must have a type.xml file in ~/.magick, which you can create 4using lib/imagemagick_fonts.pl

	To extract all available system fonts from type xml, run this xmlstarlet command:

	host:~/.magick$ xmlstarlet sel -t -m //type -v @name --nl type.xml | sort > $SFB_HOME/conf/allfonts.txt

	if builder issues "delegates not available" warning, you must fix this problem with IM--hints are in the comments for includes/1000x3000skyscraper.sh

FONT REQUIREMENTS

	For the print cover builder to work properly, the system must have the truetype font OCBR installed, usually at /usr/share/fonts/truetype.

	A free copy is available at http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/fonts/ocr.zip.


ADD TO SYSTEM CRON JOBS

	bin/update-calibre.sh should run every week so that calibre is always at the latest version
	
	Most recently tested using calibre for Linux version 1.0.0, but both earlier and later versions should probably work as well.

	There must be a magento cron job running as bitnami.


LIB DEPENDENCIES

	Latest version of unoconv must be built in lib/unoconv. 
	
	jshon
		libjansson4 must be installed to support jshon
		deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/petri/ppa/ubuntu lucid main 

		deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/petri/ppa/ubuntu lucid main 
		deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/petri/ppa/ubuntu lucid main 

	WordCloud

		
		By default, the WordCloud stopword file includes stop words that screen out most Wikipedia labels. The path to the WordCloud stopword file must be hand edited in lib/IBMcloud/examples/configuration.txt to point to the correct local path on your machine. The stop word file should also be in lib/IBMcloud/examples.

PYTHON DEPENDENCIES

	flickrapi python library must be installed from 
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flickrapi -- python must be able to find 
the correct path to import os

	Python isn't seeing the api, need to add to .bashrc (temp fix): export PYTHONPATH = $PYTHONPATH:/opt/bitnami/python/lib/python2.6/site-packages/flickrapi-1.4.2-py2.6.egg

	PKsum.py requires several python libraries including scipy and numpy.

		scipy, numpy, codecs, os
		sys, nltk, collections, sklearn.feature_extraction.text, networkx, time
		scipy.spatial.distance
	
	For bitnami, these libraries must be installed in /opt/bitnami/... via the following command:

		sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install --install-option="--prefix= /opt/bitnami/python" {your package here}
	
	The user's /home/.bashrc file must include these libraries via the Python path:

		export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/opt/bitnami/python/lib/python2.6/site-packages/fl 
ickrapi-1.4.2-py2.6.egg
		export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/opt/bitnami/python/lib/python2.6/site-packages
		export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages
		export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages
		export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages

	In Ubuntu these lines must be located in the ./bashrc file *before* the test for noninteractive shell at the top.

RUBY, JAVA, and PHP dependencies

The "t" command line twitter client requires RVM and Ruby 1.9.3 or greater.

In non-shell logins (as when a script launches another) the Java PATH must be specified -- here, /opt/bitnami/java/bin.

The fbcmd command line facebook client requires PHP5 and issues an error message if it is not available. 

STORE INTEGRATION

	Magento is currently the only e-commerce solution supported. The 
files includes/metadata-footer.sh and metadata-header.sh write a csv 
file of catalog metadata that Magento can import.  Nagento is available 
as a bitnami module.  The system has only been tested with Magento 
1.7.0.2.

	When a customer creates a book from within the Magento store 
front, the Magento webforms module creates an xmi file at $WEBFORMS_XML.  
The inotify and incrontab programes are used to trigger a run of 
SFB-production which creates the books and catalog metadata files. 
Development environment uses inotify 0.5.9.  Properly constructed 
incrontab table to trigger running xform.sh is found in 
scripts/crontabs/incrontab.

	xform.sh is the program that translates form input from Magento into  a command line with options.  xform.sh is stored in the main repository (pk-main) but is only operational in the production environment.  There is a hand-coded hard link in the file.

	The file bin/receivng_dock.sh runs a Magento import script and 
processes queued-up catalog metadata files and their accompanying books.  
The receiving dock program can be run either at will or as a cron job.

	The bin/import_cron.php program must be hand-edited so that the profile number matches the Importer in System > Import/Export > DataFlow - Advanced Profiles
