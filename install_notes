# INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS AND NOTES

## QUICK START
git clone https://github.com/fredzannarbor/pagekicker-community.git
cd pagekicker-community
./simple-install.sh

To verify success --

cd scripts # all scripts must be run from this directory, i.e. pagekicker-community/scripts
../test/paella.sh # builds simple test book which can be found in /tmp/pagekicker latest directory

The script may take quite a while to install the entire platform including Ubuntu and Python dependencies, perhaps 30 min on a 12 MB download.

##  NOTES

### OS Requirements

Install script has currently been tested only on Ubuntu 16.04.

###  IMAGEMAGICK REQUIREMENTS

	Version 6.8.9 or higher.

  	if builder.sh issues "delegates not available" warning, you must fix this problem by modifying IM setup IM--hints are in the comments for includes/1000x3000skyscraper.sh

	You must move conf/colors.xml to the imagemagick configuration directory, which is ~/.magick in my system

	You must have a type.xml file in ~/.magick, which you can create 4using lib/imagemagick_fonts.pl

	To extract all available system fonts from type xml, run this xmlstarlet command:

	host:~/.magick$ xmlstarlet sel -t -m //type -v @name --nl type.xml | sort > $SFB_HOME/conf/allfonts.txt

###  FONT REQUIREMENTS

  To list all fonts available to imagemagick, run identify -list font

	For the print cover builder program to work properly, the system must have the truetype font OCBR installed, usually at /usr/share/fonts/truetype.

	A free copy is available at http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/fonts/ocr.zip.


### CREATE SYSTEM CRON JOBS

	bin/update-calibre.sh should run every week so that calibre is always at the latest version

### LIB DEPENDENCIES

#### Word Cloud

The system currently uses a deprecated version of IBM's WordCloud software, a java bin that is no longer available online.  This needs to be remedied by replacing it with another open source package.  In the meantime, the binary is delivered via simple-install.sh in scripts/lib.

By default, the WordCloud stopword file includes stop words that screen out most Wikipedia labels. The path to the WordCloud stopword file must be hand edited in lib/IBMcloud/examples/configuration.txt to point to the correct local path on your machine. The stop word file should also be in lib/IBMcloud/examples.

#### UNOCONV (headless Open Office)
	Latest version of unoconv must be built in lib/unoconv.

####	jshon
		libjansson4 must be installed to support jshon
		deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/petri/ppa/ubuntu lucid main

		deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/petri/ppa/ubuntu lucid main
		deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/petri/ppa/ubuntu lucid main

###  PYTHON DEPENDENCIES

Handled in simple-install.sh via pip3 install -r requirements.txt

#### BITNAMI PYTHON

    On Bitnami export PYTHONPATH = $PYTHONPATH:/opt/bitnami/python/lib/python2.6/site-packages/flickrapi-1.4.2-py2.6.egg


For bitnami, these libraries must be installed in /opt/bitnami/... via the following command:

	sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install --install-option="--prefix= /opt/bitnami/python" {your package here}

The user's /home/.bashrc file must include these libraries via the Python path:

	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/opt/bitnami/python/lib/python2.6/site-packages/fl
ickrapi-1.4.2-py2.6.egg
	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/opt/bitnami/python/lib/python2.6/site-packages
	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages
	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages
	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages

In Ubuntu these lines must be located in the ./bashrc file *before* the test for noninteractive shell at the top.

### RUBY, JAVA, and PHP dependencies

The "t" command line twitter client requires RVM and Ruby 1.9.3 or greater.

In non-shell logins (as when a script launches another) the Java PATH must be specified -- here, /opt/bitnami/java/bin.

The facebook-cli command line facebook client requires PHP5 and issues an error message if it is not available.

### STORE INTEGRATION

Magento is currently the only e-commerce solution supported. The
files includes/metadata-footer.sh and metadata-header.sh write a csv
file of catalog metadata that Magento can import.  Nagento is available
as a bitnami module.  The system has only been tested with Magento
1.7.0.2.

When a customer creates a book from within the Magento store
front, the Magento webforms module creates an xmi file at $WEBFORMS_XML.
The inotify and incrontab programes are used to trigger a run of
SFB-production which creates the books and catalog metadata files.
Development environment uses inotify 0.5.9.  Properly constructed
incrontab table to trigger running xform.sh is found in
scripts/crontabs/incrontab.

xform.sh is the program that translates form input from Magento into  a command line with options.  xform.sh is stored in the main repository (pk-main) but is only operational in the production environment.  There is a hand-coded hard link in the file.

The file bin/receivng_dock.sh runs a Magento import script and
processes queued-up catalog metadata files and their accompanying books.
The receiving dock program can be run either at will or as a cron job.

The bin/import_cron.php program must be hand-edited so that the profile number matches the Importer in System > Import/Export > DataFlow - Advanced Profiles
