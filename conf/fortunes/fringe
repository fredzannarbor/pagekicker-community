Peter: Let me ask you something. My father... not my favorite. He is without a doubt the most self-absorbed, twisted, abusive, brilliant, myopic son of a bitch on the planet... So he was a chemist. That much I already know. He worked out of a basement lab in Harvard doing research for a toothpaste company. I also know that there was an accident at the lab one night and my father was arrested, beginning the first truly peaceful period in our home. But here's the thing, Olivia. My gut tells me that your friend's life... the one hanging in the balance... not gonna be saved by a tube of toothpaste.
Olivia: [Pause] He worked out of Harvard, but not on toothpaste. He was part of a classified U.S. Army experimental program called Kelvin Genetics. They gave him their resources to do whatever work he wanted, which was primarily in an area called Fringe Science.
Peter: When you say 'Fringe Science', you mean pseudo science?
Olivia: I suppose. Things like mind-control, teleportation, astral projection, invisibility, genetic mutation, re-animation--
Peter: Whoa, excuse me for a sec, re-animation? Really? So you're telling me... what? My father was Dr. Frankenstein?

Bark like a dog, dance a jig, wash the car...
Peter: The U.S. government had you working on mind control?
Walter: Not the government. It was an advertising agency. They hoped to broadcast the flashing lights during commercials so the viewers would have no choice but to buy their products.

Peter: I already know all that. Walter told me, but what were you doing there?
September: It was important. You are important. It was why I could not allow you to drown at the bottom of Reiden Lake. It was necessary to allow the other Dr. Bishop to cure you instead. Despite my efforts to set things right, these actions only culminated to further corruption of the timeline. The war between the two universes, drastically altered destinies, brought about a child that was not meant to be.
Peter: What child?
September: Your son: Henry.
Peter: My what?
September: He was born to the wrong Olivia Dunham, due to a series of circumstances that never should have happened. This event would have irrevocably altered everything that was to come.
Peter: Henry. [smiles] I have a son.
September: Had. When you made the sacrifice to step into that machine, you were not the only one that ceased to exist; so would he. I believed at the time that would be the end of it. I can't explain, but it is clear that I was wrong. You have managed to return to physical form. I suspect this will provide an opportunity to set things right. She is the one. The Olivia Dunham from whom your shared future was meant to spring. This must be, and everything will be as it was intended. You must find a way. [becomes distracted] They are coming. You need to go.

Peter: I saw her! I saw my Olivia. The one that I'm supposed to be with. The only one that I'm supposed to be with.
Olivia: Peter, I don't understand what's happening to me anymore than you do, but that doesn't change what I do know, what you know, that if you look at me, if you look into my eyes, then you can see that I am her.
Peter: No. No. You have her memories. You have my memories of her or your projection, but when I looked into your eyes, what I saw was what I wanted to see. I know she's out there. My Olivia in my timeline, waiting for me, and I let myself forget that. So I'm sorry, Olivia, but I'm sure Walter can fix you up somehow and give you back your life, but right now it's better if I stay away.

I remember how it smelled, how I felt, how scared I was, how all alone I was, and now years later nothing's changed. I'm still that little girl and William Bell is still doing experiments on me. I'm still being used.
Peter: No, something has changed: this time you're not alone.

Olivia: Peter --
Peter: I just figured after everything we've been through in the last couple of days -- the last couple of years -- I thought we deserved a little bit of normal.
Olivia: It's perfect.
Peter: I suppose that he was right, the Observer. I every version of the future you had to die, but I never want to lose you again. [they hug, but Peter notices Olivia's apprehension] What? Are you okay? Did the doctor tell you anything else?
Olivia: Actually, he did.
Peter: What?
Olivia: Peter, I'm pregnant.

Peter: Oh my God. What is that, punishment food?

Peter: What did they do to the park?
Etta: They paved it to build machines that pump carbon monoxide into the atmosphere.
Astrid: Why?
Etta: There's one in every continent. The air here is too oxygen rich for them. Few more years and the effects will be irreversible, to reduce the non-Observer life span to somewhere around, 45.

Peter: Where is she?
Markham: All of you....
Peter: Where is she?
Markham: Why haven't you aged? How did you not age?
Peter: We know you bought her. [Peter notices the amber chunk on the floor that is being used as a table now, with Olivia in it]
Markham: I love her. From the first time she came into my book store. I never meant her any harm.
Peter: [pointing the gun at Edward] How did you get her in here? You had to use a dolly or something.
Markham: It's not supposed to happen this way. She's supposed to wake up and see me as her saviour, when I figure exactly how to wake her up.

Walter: There was a time when we solved Fringe cases. Now I think it's time we created a few of our own.

Olivia: Where did you get that?
Etta: I found it in our old house on Quincy Street. I wanted to remember things. I don't know. I just wanted to be there. It made me feel closer to you. It was looted; the entire block was. Upstairs in your bedroom, what used to be your bedroom, I found what was left of your old jewelry box. There was this matchbook inside and I shook it. Inside I found this. I figured it had to be important or you wouldn't have kept it.
Olivia: How long have you been wearing it?
Etta: Since I was thirteen. You want it back?
Olivia: No, no. I want you to keep it. Let me see it. [smiles] You know, your father used to call this the bullet that saved the world.

Broyles: When I heard that you were back, I tried not to, but I had to see you. Five years ago I got called to a crime scene outside the city. I saw Etta for the first time, and even though she was turned away from me I could have sworn I was looking at you. It wasn't until I told her who I was that she admitted the truth: that she was your daughter. Once I knew, I had her transferred to my section. I had a mind that I was going to look after her, but she taught me. She recruited me into the resistance. Taught me how to block them from reading my thoughts.
Peter: How long did that take?
Broyles: Nearly a year.

Astrid: Hey, I ran into a bit of a fire hazard so there's no tape yet.
Peter: What is that?
Astrid: You see that white tubey thing? That is a propane tank for Walter's hibachi. And that see-through blob over there? That is a gallon of ethanol.
Walter: Abner, why did you leave the propane tank there in the first place?
Astrid: Someone wanted to cook bratwurst.
Walter: Well, why is the ethanol there and not in the cupboard?
Astrid: Because someone wanted to use the ethanol to clean the hibachi before they cooked the bratwurst.

Olivia: Simone, you have a gift. You can see things that other people can't. I don't doubt that. But wherever you think this gift came from, or whoever you think bestowed it upon you, it's simply an anomaly. I know that because I'm an anomaly. I have moved things with my mind. I've lit things on fire. I've caught bullets midair. I've seen things that people only dream about. I've seen... the seams between universes ripped apart. Things that humans shouldn't see. People make up explanations, assign meanings to things without knowing, because it's reassuring, comforting. But I can't do that. Because I know too much. It's all just numbers. And the invaders, as you call them—— they're just better at math than we are.

Peter: Yes, he did.
Olivia: No, he didn't. She's still here with us.
Peter: She is dead.
Olivia: She saved my life today with the bullet she brought to us. She's alive inside us. And there's nothing that Windmark can do about it, because the love that we can share with her now is invulnerable to space and time, even to them. And I know that our hearts are broken and that it hurts, but that's what makes us human.
Peter: Emotion is our weakness.
Olivia: No, Peter, it's our strength, because it's the one thing that they don't have. Now, we need to hold on to our connection with Etta, feeling what we felt for her, or she dies all over again. And we cannot let her be erased. Peter— Peter, I'm not asking you to abandon her. I'm asking you to hold on to her. You're not one of them, you're one of us.
