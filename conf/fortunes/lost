Kate Austen: You don't seem afraid at all. I don't understand that.
Jack Shephard: Well, fear's sort of an odd thing. When I was in residency, my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery on a 16 year old kid, a girl. And at the end, after 13 hours, I was closing her up and I, I accidentally ripped her dural sac. Shredded the base of the spine where all the nerves come together, membrane as thin as tissue. And so it ripped open. And the nerves just spilled out of her like angel hair pasta, spinal fluid flowing out of her and I … And the terror was just so … crazy. So real. And I knew I had to deal with it. So I just made a choice. I'd let the fear in, let it take over, let it do its thing, but only for five seconds, that's all I was going to give it. So I started to count: One, two, three, four, five. Then it was gone. I went back to work, sewed her up and she was fine.
Kate Austen: If that had been me, I think I would have run for the door.
Jack Shephard: No, I don't think that's true. You're not running now.

Which means that there's a mother nearby. A 250 pound rat, with scimitar like tusks, a surly disposition, who'd love nothing more than to eviscerate anything that comes near it. Boar's usual mode of attack is to circle around and charge from behind so I figure it'll take at least three of us to distract her long enough for me to flank one of the piglets, pin it and slit its throat.

Boone Carlyle: So, not to be too difficult, but we've been coming here for two days just staring at this thing. I'm not really sure what we're supposed to be doing.
John Locke: Ludovico Buonarrati, Michelangelo's father. He was a wealthy man. He had no understanding of the divinity in his son, so he beat him. No child of his was going to use his hands for a living. So, Michelangelo learned not to use his hands. Years later a visiting prince came into Michelangelo's studio and found the master staring at a single 18 foot block of marble. Then he knew that the rumors were true -- that Michelangelo had come in everyday for the last four months, stared at the marble, and gone home for his supper. So the prince asked the obvious -- what are you doing? And Michelangelo turned around and looked at him, and whispered, sto lavorando, I'm working. Three years later that block of marble was the statue of David.

John Locke: My sister, Jeanie, died when I was a boy. Fell off the monkey bars and broke her neck. And my mother, well, my foster mother, she blamed herself, of course. She thought she wasn't watching close enough. So, she stopped eating, stopped sleeping. The neighbors started talking, afraid she might do something to herself, I guess. [Sipping coffee] Oh, that's good. Anyway, about 6 months after Jeanie's funeral, this golden retriever comes padding up our driveway, walks right into our house, sits down on the floor, and looks right at my mother, there on the couch. And my mother looks back at the dog. After about a minute of this, of them both staring at each other like that, my mother burst into tears. Beautiful dog, no tags, no collar, healthy, and sweet. The dog slept in Jeanie's old room, on Jeanie's old bed and stayed with us until my mother passed 5 years later. Then, disappeared back to wherever it was she came from in the first place.
Kate Austen: So, you're saying the dog was your sister?
John Locke: Well, that would be silly. But my mother thought it was, thought that Jeanie had come back to tell her the accident wasn't her fault, let her off the hook.

And right now, he thinks that I hate him. He thinks I feel betrayed by him. But what I really feel is gratitude, and pride because of what he did to me. What he did for me. It took more courage than I have. There's a pay phone over here. I could pick it up and I could call my son. I could tell him about all this. I could tell him that I love him.

Martha Toomey: Sam and Leonard were stationed at a listening post monitoring long wave transmissions out of the Pacific. Boring job. Sam hated it, nothing to do but listen to static night after night. Until one night, about 16 years ago, there's something in the static, a voice comes through, a voice repeating those numbers over and over again. [Hurley nearly spills his tea.] A couple of days later we're at the fair in Kalgoorlie and some wally there has got this jar, must have been big as a pony, and it's filled to the rim with beans. Fella's offering 50 grand to anyone able to guess how many beans are in that jar, within 10.
Hugo "Hurley" Reyes: Sam used the numbers?
Martha Toomey: Yep, the answer was exact. To the bean. Men had been running the same scam for 40 years and nobody had ever come close. So we won the money. On the way home a pick-up truck blows a tire on the highway, hits us head on. Lost my leg that night.
Hugo "Hurley" Reyes: What about Sam?
Martha Toomey: Barely a scratch. Most people would consider themselves lucky, but not him. He was never the same after that. He started keeping a record. Anything terrible that happened to anyone around us, he believed it was all because he used those numbers. He moved us out here in the middle of nowhere hoping it would stop.
Hugo "Hurley" Reyes: Did it? Did he ever find a way to make it stop?

John Locke: Francine feels a little too much if you ask me. You all do. I mean, seriously: "So-and-so never called me back", "my mother stole 30 dollars from me". I never even knew who my parents were. A couple of years ago, my birth mother found me, and... She told me, I was special! And through her, I met my real father. Great news, right? Well, he pretended to love me just long enough to steal my kidney because he needed a transplant! And then he dropped me back in the world like a piece of trash. Just like he did on the day that I was born! You want your damned 30 dollars back? I want my kidney back!!!

Pierre Chang: [as Marvin Candle] Welcome, I'm Dr. Marvin Candle, and this is the orientation film for Station 3 of the DHARMA Initiative. In a moment you'll be given a simple set of instructions for how you and your partner will fulfill the responsibilities associated with the station. But first, a little history. The DHARMA Initiative was created in 1970, and it is the brainchild of Gerald and Karen DeGroot -- two doctoral candidates at the University of Michigan. Following in the footsteps of visionaries such as B.F. Skinner--
[the film skips]
Pierre Chang: --imagined a large scale communal research compound where scientists and free thinkers from around the globe could pursue research in meteorology, psychology, parapsychology, zoology, electromagnetism, and Utopian social--
[the film skips]
Pierre Chang: --Danish industrialist and munitions magnate Alvar Hanso whose financial backing made their dream of a multi-purpose social science research facility a reality. You and your partner are currently located in Station 3, or the Swan, and will be for the next 540 days. The Station 3 was originally constructed as a laboratory where scientists could work to understand the unique electromagnetic fluctuations emanating from this sector of the Island. Not long after the experiments began, however, there was an incident. And since that time the following protocol has been observed: every 108 minutes the button must be pushed. From the moment the alarm sounds you will have 4 minutes to enter the code into the microcomputer processor--
[the film skips]
Pierre Chang: --induction into the program. When the alarm sounds, either you or your partner must input the code. It is highly recommended that you and your partner take alternating shifts. In this manner you will stay as fresh and alert--
[the film skips]
Pierre Chang: --utmost importance that when the alarm sounds the code be entered correctly, and in a timely fashion. Do not attempt to use the computer--
[the film skips]
Pierre Chang: --for anything--
[the film skips]
Pierre Chang: --Congratulations, until your replacements arrive, the future of the project is in your hands. On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso and all of us at the DHARMA Initiative, thank you. Namaste. And good luck.

Jack Shephard: It says "quarantine" on the inside of the hatch to keep you down here. To keep you scared. But you know what? We've been up there for over 40 days and no one's gotten sick. You think that this is the only part of it that's true?! Do you ever think that maybe they put you down here to push a button every 100 minutes just to see if you would? That all of this -- the computer, the button -- it's just a mind game?! An experiment?
Desmond Hume: Every -- single -- day. And for all our sakes, I hope it's not real. But the film says this is an electromagnetic station. And I don't know about you, brother, but every time I walk past that concrete wall out there, my fillings hurt.

Mr. Eko: Hello. I have something I think you should see. If you don't mind, I will begin at the beginning. Long before Christ, the king of Judah was a man named Josiah.
John Locke: Boy, when you say beginning, you mean beginning.
Mr. Eko: At that time the temple where the people worshiped was in ruin. And so the people worshiped idols, false gods. And so the kingdom was in disarray. Josiah, since he was a good king, sent his secretary to the treasury and said: "We must rebuild the temple. Give all of the gold to the workers so that this will be done." But when the secretary returned, he had no gold. And when Josiah asked why this was, the secretary replied, "We found a book." Do you know this story?
John Locke: No, I'm afraid I don't.
Mr. Eko: What the secretary had found was an ancient book -- the Book of Law. You may know it as the Old Testament. And it was with that ancient book, not with the gold, that Josiah rebuilt the temple. On the other side of the island we found a place much like this, and in this place we found a book. [Eko unwraps the book and pushes it toward Locke] I believe what's inside there will be of great value to you.

Jack Shephard: 50 days.
Tom Friendly: Oooo, 50 days. That's what, almost 2 whole months, huh? Tell me, you go over a man's house for the first time, do you take off your shoes? Do you put your feet up on his coffee table? Do you walk in the kitchen, eat food that doesn't belong to you? [to Locke] Open the door to rooms you got no business opening? [to all] You know, somebody a whole lot smarter than anybody here once said: "Since the dawn of our species man's been blessed with curiosity." You know the other one about curiosity, don't you, Jack? This is not your island. This is our island. And the only reason you're living on it...is 'cause we let you live on it.

John Locke: Maybe your people were looking for this place.
Ben Linus/Henry Gale: This place? This place is a joke, John.
John Locke: What are you talking about?
Ben Linus/Henry Gale: I crawled through your vents and I stood at your computer as the alarm beeped. And you know what happened? The timer went all the way down to zero, and then some funny red pictures flipped up in its place. They looked like hieroglyphics, but I'm no expert. And then things got real interesting. There was a loud clunking and a hum like a magnet -- a big magnet. It was really very frightening. And you know what happened next? Nothing happened, John. Nothing happened at all. Your timer just flipped back to 108. I never entered the numbers. I never pressed the button.

Mr. Eko: And why is your wife so convinced otherwise?
Richard Malkin: Because she's a zealot. All of this -- everything she's doing -- is to spite me.

Mr. Eko: This cross was worn by my brother, Yemi. Yemi was a great man, a priest, a man of God. And because I betrayed him he was shot and died. He was placed on a plane which took off from an airstrip in Nigeria half a world from here. Then, the plane that I was on crashed on this island. And somehow, here, I found my brother again. I found him in the same plane that took off from Nigeria. In the same plane that lies above us now -- that has concealed this place. And I took this cross from around Yemi's neck and put it back on mine, just as it was on the day I first took another man's life. So let me ask you -- how can you say this is meaningless? I believe the work being done in the Hatch is more important than anything. If you will not continue to push the button, John, I will.

And then one day, the boy confessed to me that he had beaten his dog to death with a shovel. He said that the dog had bitten his baby sister on the cheek; and he needed to protect her. And he wanted to know whether he would go to hell for this. I told him that God would understand -- that he would be forgiven, as long as he was sorry. But the boy did not care about forgiveness. He was only afraid that if he did go to hell -- that dog would be there waiting for him.

Mikhail Bakunin: I grew up in Kiev and joined the Soviet Army. I was stationed at a listening post at Vladivostok. After the Cold War, after we lost the Cold War, my unit was decommissioned. I was dismissed from my life in the military. And after years of conducting unpleasant actions against our enemies, I found myself wanting to do something good. So I replied to a newspaper advertisement.
Sayid Jarrah: An advertisement?
Mikhail Bakunin: 'Would you like to save the world?' it read. That's how I met them, the Initiative. They're very secretive, very rich, very smart.
Sayid Jarrah: So, when did you come to the island?
Mikhail Bakunin: 11 years now. I like computers, communications equipment, being alone like a lighthouse keeper. So they put me in this station. They called it The Flame.

Amira: After my husband and I first arrived to Paris, I was afraid to ever leave our apartment. So I would stare out in the window into the alley, and I would see this cat looking for scraps. One day some children came into the alley and trapped him in a box. I watched them light firecrackers and drop them in the box. I could hear him howl from three stories above. So finally, I had a reason to leave my apartment. I rescued this cat and I brought him home. He sits with me when I read, sleeps with me, and he purrs. But, every once in a while, he will bite me or scratch me. He does this because sometimes he forgets that he is safe now. So I forgive him when he bites me, because I remember what it is like to never feel safe. And that is because of you. So today, I ask only one thing of you: I ask you now to show me the respect by acknowledging what you did to me. That it was you who questioned me, tortured me and that you remember me.
Sayid Jarrah: I remember you. I remember your face. Your face has haunted me ever since I left Iraq. [crying] I am sorry. I am so sorry for what I did to you. I am sorry.
Amira: I forgive you. When my husband returns, I will tell I made a terrible mistake, that it was not you, and he will release you.
Sayid Jarrah: Why? Why are you letting me go?

John Locke: James! Don't!
James "Sawyer" Ford: Don't what!? Anyone wanna tell me why we're keeping this guy alive?
John Locke: We're keeping him alive because he's been on this Island a lot longer than any of us. Because he has information we need. And because apart from his mouth, he's completely harmless.
James "Sawyer" Ford: His mouth put that hole in your gut?
John Locke: Okay, James. Let's execute him, right here, right now, in front of his daughter.
James "Sawyer" Ford: It's only a matter of time before he gets us, Johnny. And I bet he's already figured out how he's gonna do it.

Daniel Faraday: I think Eloise's brain short-circuited. The jumps between the present and the future eventually, she eventually, she couldn't tell which was which. She had no anchor.

Daniel Faraday: Something familiar in both times. All this, see all this is all variables. It's random; it's chaotic. Every equation needs stability, something known. It's called a "constant." Desmond, you have no constant. When you go to the future nothing there is familiar. So if you want to stop this, then you need to find something there, something that you really, really care about, something that also exists back here in 1996.

Gault: [to Desmond and Sayid] This black box comes from Oceanic Flight 815. A salvage vessel recovered it from the bottom of the ocean. It took a considerable amount of Mr. Widmore's resources to procure it. It was found with the wreckage of the plane, along with all 324 dead passengers. That's not the complete story, as you are well aware, Mr. Jarrah, given the fact that you're standing here, breathing... the wreckage was obviously staged. Now can you imagine what kind of resources and manpower go into pulling off a feat of that magnitude? Faking the recovery of a plane crash? Putting 324 families through a grieving process based on a lie? But what's even more disturbing... where exactly does one come across 324 dead bodies?

Hugo "Hurley" Reyes: All of us--the Oceanic Six, we lied about what happened after the crash.
Carmen Reyes: And what did happen?
Hugo "Hurley" Reyes: Okay. See, we did crash, but it was on this crazy island. And we waited for rescue, and there wasn't any rescue. And there was a smoke monster, and then there were other people on the island. We called them the Others, and they started attacking us. And we found some hatches, and there was a button you had to push every 108 minutes or... well, I was never really clear on that. But... the Others didn't have anything to do with the hatches. That was the DHARMA Initiative. The Others killed them, and now they're trying to kill us. And then we teamed up with the Others because some worse people were coming on a freighter. Desmond's girlfriend's father sent them to kill us. So we stole their helicopter and we flew it to their freighter, but it blew up. And we couldn't go back to the island because it disappeared, so then we crashed into the ocean, and we floated there for a while until a boat came and picked us up. And by then, there were six of us. That part was true. But the re...But the rest of the people... who were on the plane? They're still on that island.

And this containment--the place they built over it--I believe you called it "the Hatch." The Swan hatch? Because of this one accident, these people are gonna spend the next 20 years keeping that energy at bay... by pressing a button... a button that your friend Desmond will one day fail to push, and that will cause your plane--Oceanic 815--to crash on this Island. And because your plane crashed, a freighter will be sent to this Island--a freighter I was on and Charlotte was on and so forth. This entire chain of events--it's gonna start happening this afternoon. But... we can change that. I studied relativistic physics my entire life. One thing emerged over and over--can't change the past. Can't do it. Whatever happened, happened. All right? But then I finally realized... I had been spending so much time focused on the constants, I forgot about the variables. Do you know what the variables in these equations are, Jack?
Jack Shephard: No.
Daniel Faraday: Us. We're the variables. People. We think. We reason. We make choices. We have free will. We can change our destiny. I think I can negate that energy under the Swan. I think I can destroy it. If I can, then that hatch will never be built, and your plane... your plane will land, just like it's supposed to, in Los Angeles.
Kate Austen: And just how exactly do you plan on destroying this energy?
Daniel Faraday: I'm gonna detonate a hydrogen bomb.

What the last thought that ran through his head was? [imitating Locke] "I don't understand". [smiles] Isn't that just the saddest thing you ever heard? But it's fitting in a way, because when John first came to the Island, he was a very sad man. A victim, shouting at the world for being told what he couldn't do, even though they were right. He was weak, and pathetic, and irreparably broken. But, despite all that, there was something admirable about him. He was the only one of them that didn't wanna leave.

From what I hear, now anyone who works for Paik knows the cardinal rule - hands off the boss's daughter. But you, you couldn't resist her, could you? The heart wants what the heart wants.

Jack Shephard: You look just like him.
The Man in Black: Does it bother you?
Jack Shephard: No, what bothers me is I have no idea what the hell you are.
The Man in Black: Sure you do.
Jack Shephard: Why John Locke?
The Man in Black: Because he was stupid enough to believe he had been brought here for a reason. Because he pursued that belief until it got him killed. And because you were kind enough to bring his body back here in a nice little wooden box.
Jack Shephard: And he had to be dead before you could look like him?
The Man in Black: That's right.
Jack Shephard: And who else have you looked like?
The Man in Black: Jack, what do you really want to ask me?
Jack Shephard: Our third day here, I chased my father through the jungle, my dead father. Was that you?
The Man in Black: Yes, that was me.
Jack Shephard: Why?
The Man in Black: You needed to find water. Jack, I know this must be hard for you to understand, but all I've ever tried to do is help you.
Jack Shephard: To "help me?" To do what?
The Man in Black: Leave! But because Jacob chose you, you were trapped on this Island, before you even got here. Now Jacob's dead, we don't need to be trapped here. We can get on a plane and fly away anytime we want.
Jack Shephard: If we could just get on a plane and fly away, why would you even still be here?
The Man in Black: Because it has to be all of us.
[Jack still looks uncertain]
The Man in Black: What?
Jack Shephard: John Locke was the only one of us who ever believed in this place. He did everything he could to keep us from leaving this Island.
The Man in Black: John Locke was not a believer, Jack. He was a sucker.

Jack Shephard: No he's not! Locke can't kill us.
Hugo "Hurley" Reyes: Uhh, what?
Jack Shephard: This is what he wanted. This has been what he has been waiting for. Everything that he has done has been to get us here. He wanted to get us all at the same place at the same time in a nice enclosed space where we had no hopes of getting out.
Jin Kwon: I don't understand.
Jack Shephard: Locke said that he couldn't leave the Island without us. I think that he can't leave the Island unless we're all dead. He told me that he could kill any one of us whenever he wanted, so what if he hasn't because he's not allowed to? What if he's trying to get us to kill each other?
James "Sawyer" Ford: Stay out of my way Doc.
Jack Shephard: If he wanted that thing to blow up, why did he put a timer on it? Why not just throw it inside?

Man In Black: Well, Mother, you should be. I spent 30 years searching for that place you brought me as a child--that...waterfall with that beautiful light. I’ve walked this island from end to end, not once coming close to finding it. But, then I began to think--what if the light underneath the island--what if I could get to it from someplace else? Figuring out how to reach it took a very long time.
Mother: The people with you, they saw this, too?

John Locke: [to Jack] We've been waiting for you.
Lindelof: The first meeting I had with J.J. about Lost, we talked about The Stand, and it kept suggesting ideas throughout the process. The character of Charlie was always going to be a druggie rocker, but when Dominic Monaghan came in to audition we started saying, ”What if he was a one-hit wonder?” I said, ”Like the guy in The Stand! The guy with just this one song.[2]
Lindelof: So, per J.J., we made a very specific effort in this document to say we were not going to be serialized, we were not going to be genre and we were not going to do what Alias had done. So even though I think it was our intention to do all of the above, we needed to put that in the document because the document was essentially a letter to ABC saying ‘Here’s what the show’s going to be.’
By the time we started breaking the first two episodes, it was already very clear to everyone in the room that the document that we had written to get the show picked up was going to be completely and totally null and void.[3]
