Governor Tarkin:
	The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any
	concern to us. I have just received word
	that the Emperor has dissolved the council
	permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic
	have been swept away.
Commander:
	But that's impossible. How will the emperor
	maintain control without the bureaucracy?
Governor Tarkin:
	The regional governors now have direct
	control over their territories. Fear will keep the
	local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.

Luke Skywalker:
	I'm Luke Skywalker, I'm here to rescue you.
%
C-3PO: 
	We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life.
%
Princess Leia Organa: 
	Help me, Obi-wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
%
Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi: 
	For more than a thousand generations
	the Jedi were the guardians of peace and
	justice in the galaxy. Before the dark times.
	Before the Empire.
%
Luke Skywalker:
	How did my father die?
Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi:
	A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil
	of mine until he turned to evil, helped the
	Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights.
	He betrayed and murdered your father.
%
Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi:
	Mos Eisley spaceport. You will never find a more
	wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be
	cautious.
%
Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi:
	The Force can have a strong influence on a weak mind.
%
Han Solo:
	Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.
	Chewie here tells me you're lookin' for passage
	to the Alderaan system?
Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi:
	Yes indeed, if it's a fast ship.
Han Solo:
	Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium
	Falcon?
%
Luke Skywalker:
	What a piece of junk!
Han Solo:
	She'll make point five past lightspeed. She may
	not look like much but she's got it where it counts,
	kid. I've made a lot of special modifications myself.
%
Han Solo:
	Watch your mouth, kid, or you're gonna find
	yourself floating home.
%
Darth Vader:
	I find your lack of faith disturbing.
%
Darth Vader:
	Don't be too proud of this technological
	terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy
	a planet is insignificant next to the power of the
	Force.
%
Princess Leia:
	The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the
	more star systems will slip through your fingers.
%
C-3PO: 
	Listen to them, they're dying, R2! Curse my metal
	body! I wasn't fast enough! It's all my fault! My
	poor master!

Two stormtroopers are posted near the tractor beam power
terminal.
Stormtrooper:
	Do you know what's going on?
Other stormtrooper:
	Maybe it's another drill.
%
Darth Vader:
	I sense something. A presence I've not felt since...
%
Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi:
	You must learn the ways of the Force
	if you are to come with me to Alderaan.
%
C-3PO: 
	Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight
	glob of grease!
%
C-3PO: 
	We're doomed!
%
Han Solo:
	Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her
	or I'm beginning to like her.
%
Han Solo:
	Damn fool, I knew you were going to say that.
Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi:
	Who's the more foolish, the fool, or the fool who
	follows him?
%
Han Solo:
	Traveling through hyperspace ain't like dusting
	crops, boy.
%
Princess Leia:
	Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?
%
Han Solo:
	Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what
	you smell!
%
Han Solo:
	This is not going to work.
Luke Skywalker:
	Why didn't you say so before?
Han Solo:
	I did say so before!

Princess Leia gets her first look at the Millennium Falcon.
Princess Leia:
	You came in that thing? You're braver than I thought!

Luke blows up his first TIE fighter.
Luke Skywalker:
	Got 'im! I got 'im!
Han Solo:
	Great, kid! Don't get cocky!
%
Darth Vader:
	The Force is strong with this one.
%
Darth Vader:
	Commander, tear this ship apart until you've
	found those plans. And bring me the passengers, I
	want them alive!
%
Princess Leia:
	Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold.
%
R2-D2 and Chewbacca are playing the holographic game aboard
the Millennium Falcon.
Chewbacca:
	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh
C-3PO: 
	He made a fair move. Screaming about it can't help you.
Han Solo:
	Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
C-3PO:
	But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
Han Solo:
	That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out
	of their sockets when they lose. Wookiees are known
	to do that.
Chewbacca:
	Grrf.
C-3PO:
	I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, R2:
	let the Wookiee win.
%
Darth Vader:
	When I left you, I was but the learner.
	Now I am the master.
%
Han Solo:
	Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes
	I amaze even myself.
Princess Leia:
	That doesn't sound too hard.
%
Darth Vader:
	Your powers are weak, old man.
Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi:
	You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall
	become more powerful than you could possibly
	imagine.
%
Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi:
	The Force will be with you, always.
%
Luke Skywalker:
	I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-16 back home.
	They're not much bigger than two meters.
%
Officer:
	We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger.
	Should I have your ship standing by?
Governor Tarkin:
	Evacuate? In our moment of triumph? I think you
	overestimate their chances.
%
Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi:
	Use the Force, Luke!
%
C-3PO: 
	Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating
	an asteroid field is approximately 3,720 to 1!
Han Solo:
	Never tell me the odds!
%
Luke can't levitate his X-Wing out of the bog.
Luke Skywalker:
	I can't. It's too big.
Yoda:
	Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size,
	do you? Hmm? Hmm. And well you should not. For my
	ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is. Life
	creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us
	and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude
	matter. You must feel the Force around you; between
	you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere. Yes, even
	between the land and the ship.
%
Han Solo:
	Afraid I was gonna leave without giving you a
	goodbye kiss?
Princess Leia:
	I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee!
Han Solo:
	I can arrange that! You could use a good kiss!
%
Han Solo:
	Well Princess, it looks like you managed to keep me
	here a while longer.
Princess Leia:
	I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks
	it's dangerous for anyone to leave the system until
	they've activated the energy shield.
Han Solo:
	That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to
	let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
Princess Leia:
	I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain!
Chewbacca laughs
Han Solo:
	Laugh it up, fuzzball!
%
Darth Vader:
	The force is with you young Skywalker, but you are
	not a Jedi yet.
%
C-3PO:
	R2 says that the chances of survival are 725 to 1.
	Actually R2 has been known to make mistakes - from time
	to time... Oh dear...
%
Han Solo:
	Oh! I thought they smelled bad on the *outside*!
%
Yoda:
	I am wondering, why are you here?
Luke Skywalker:
	I'm looking for someone.
Yoda:
	Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm?
Luke Skywalker:
	Right...
Yoda:
	Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.
Luke Skywalker:
	I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.
Yoda:
	Ohhh! Great warrior! laughs and shakes his head Wars
	not make one great!
%
Han Solo:
	You said you wanted to be around when I made a
	mistake, well, this could be it, sweetheart.
Princess Leia:
	I take it back.
%
Luke Skywalker:
	Alright, I'll give it a try.
Yoda:
	No! Try not. Do... or do not. There is no try.
%
Using the Force, Yoda effortlessly frees the X-Wing from the bog.
Luke Skywalker:
	I don't believe it.
Yoda:
	That is why you fail.
%
Darth Vader:
	Impressive. Most impressive. Obi-wan has taught
	you well. You have controlled your fear. Now,
	release your anger! Only your hatred can destroy me!
%
Darth Vader:
	There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you.
	pauses Luke, you do not yet realize your importance.
	You have only begun to discover your power. Join me,
	and I will complete your training. With our combined
	strength, we can end this destructive conflict and
	bring order to the galaxy.
Luke Skywalker:
	I'll never join you!
Darth Vader:
	If you only knew the *power* of the dark side. Obi-wan
	never told you what happened to your father.
Luke Skywalker:
	He told me enough! He told me *you* killed him.
Darth Vader:
	No. *I* am your father.
%
Princess Leia:
	I'll be back.
%
Han Solo:
	You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake,
	well, this could be it, sweetheart.
Princess Leia:
	I take it back.
%
Princess Leia:
	I love you.
Han Solo:
	I know.
%
Han Solo:
	Chewie and I will check it out, you two stay here.
Luke Skywalker:
	Quietly. There may be more of them out there.
Han Solo:
	Hey, it's me.
%
Emperor Palpatine:
	Take your Jedi weapon! Use it. Strike me down with all
	of your hatred and your journey towards the dark
	side will be complete!
%
Emperor Palpatine:
	Everything that has transpired has done so according
	to my design.
%
Emperor Palpatine:
	Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker
	will be one of us!
%
Jabba the Hutt:
	This bounty hunter is my kind of scum: fearless and
	inventive.
%
Jabba the Hutt:
	Bring me Solo and the Wookiee! They will all suffer
	for this outrage.
%
Han Solo:
	I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big
	dark blur I see a big light blur.
Luke Skywalker:
	There's nothing to see. I used to live here you know.
Han Solo:
	You're gonna die here you know. Convenient.
%
C-3PO:
	I do believe they think I am some kind of god.
Han Solo:
	Well, why don't you use your divine influence and
	get us out of this?
C-3PO:
	I beg your pardon General Solo, but that just
	wouldn't be proper.
Han Solo:
	Proper???
C-3PO:
	It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
%
Yoda:
	When nine hundred years old you reach, look as
	good you will not. Hmm?
%
Luke Skywalker:
	If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for
	the Alliance.
Princess Leia:
	Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I
	don't understand and could never have.
Luke Skywalker:
	You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In
	time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force
	runs strong in my family. My father has it. I have
	it. And... my sister has it. Yes. It's you, Leia.
Princess Leia:
	I know. Somehow, I've always known.
%
Luke Skywalker:
	Your overconfidence is your weakness.
Emperor Palpatine:
	Your faith in your friends is yours.
%
Darth Vader:
	Luke, help me take this mask off.
Luke Skywalker:
	But you'll die.
Darth Vader:
	Nothing can stop that now. Just for once, let me
	look upon you with my own eyes.
%
Han Solo:
	I love you.
Princess Leia:
	I know.
