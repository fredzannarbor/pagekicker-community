Pass into nothingness.

Love in a hut, with water and a crust,
Is--Love, forgive us!--cinders, ashes, dust;
Love in a palace is perhaps at last
More grievous torment than a hermit's fast.
JOHN KEATS, "Lamia"
%
The opinion I have of the generality of women--who appear to me as children to whom I would rather give a sugar plum than my time, forms a barrier against matrimony which I rejoice in.
JOHN KEATS, letter to George and Georgiana Keats, Oct. 14, 1818
%
Is there another life? Shall I awake and find all this a dream? There must be, we cannot be created for this sort of suffering.
JOHN KEATS, letter to Charles Brown, Sep. 30, 1820

Praise or blame has but a momentary effect on the man whose love of beauty in the abstract makes him a severe critic on his own works.

The music, yearning like a God in pain.

I shall soon be laid in the quiet grave--thank God for the quiet grave--O! I can feel the cold earth upon me--the daisies growing over me--O for this quiet--it will be my first.

Pleasure is oft a visitant; but pain
Clings cruelly to us.
JOHN KEATS, Endymion

If Poetry comes not as naturally as Leaves to a tree it had better not come at all.
JOHN KEATS, letter to John Taylor, Feb. 27, 1818

My spirit is too weak--mortality
Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep,
And each imagin'd pinnacle and steep
Of godlike hardship tells me I must die
Like a sick Eagle looking at the sky.
JOHN KEATS, "On Seeing the Elgin Marbles"

Do not all charms fly
At the mere touch of cold philosophy?

O magic sleep! O comfortable bird,
That broodest o’er the troubled sea of the mind
Till it is hush’d and smooth!

Flushing his brow, and in his pained heart
Made purple riot.

Woman! when I behold thee flippant, vain,
Inconstant, childish, proud, and full of fancies.

He ne'er is crown'd
With immortality, who fears to follow
Where airy voices lead.
JOHN KEATS, Endymion

A long poem is a test of invention which I take to be the Polar star of poetry, as fancy is the sails, and imagination the rudder.

In spite of all,
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall

JOHN KEATS, Endymion

Bright star! would I wear steadfast as thou art--
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
And watching with eternal lids apart,
Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,
The moving waters at their priestlike task
Of pure ablution round earth's human shores.
JOHN KEATS, "Bright Star"

Axioms in philosophy are not axioms until they are proved upon our pulses: we read fine things but never feel them to the full until we have gone the same steps as the author.
JOHN KEATS, letter to John Hamilton Reynolds, May 3, 1818

I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the heart's affections and the truth of imagination--what the imagination seizes as beauty must be truth--whether it existed before or not.

Away! away! I will fly to thee,
Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,
But on the viewless wings of Poesy.

Do you not see how necessary a world of pains and troubles is to school an intelligence and make it a soul.

I am certain I have not a right feeling towards women - at this moment I am striving to be just to them, but I cannot. Is it because they fall so far beneath my boyish imagination? When I was a schoolboy I thought a fair woman a pure Godess; my mind was a soft nest in which some one of them slept, though she knew it not.
JOHN KEATS, letter to Benjamin Bailey, Jul. 18, 1818

You are always new. The last of your kisses was ever the sweetest; the last smile the brightest; the last movement the gracefullest.

Open afresh your round of starry folds,
Ye ardent marigolds!
JOHN KEATS, "I Stood Tiptoe"

The common cognomen of this world among the misguided and superstitious is 'a vale of tears' from which we are to be redeemed by a certain arbitrary interposition of God and taken to Heaven--what a little circumscribed notion! Call the world if you please "the vale of soul-making". Then you will find out the use of the world.
JOHN KEATS, letter to George and Georgiana Keats, Apr. 21, 1819

Time, that aged nurse,
Rocked me to patience.

Bards of Passion and of Mirth,
Ye have left your souls on earth!
Have ye souls in heaven too,
Double-lived in regions new?
JOHN KEATS, "Ode"
%
When I have fears that I may cease to be
Before my pen has glean’d my teeming brain,
Before high piled books, in charact’ry,
Hold like rich garners the full-ripen’d grain;
When I behold, upon the night’s starr’d face,
Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,
And think that I may never live to trace
Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance;
And when I feel, fair creature of an hour!
That I shall never look upon thee more,
Never have relish in the faery power
Of unreflecting love! — then on the shore
Of the wide world I stand alone, and think
Till Love and Fame to nothingness do sink.
JOHN KEATS, "When I Have Fears that I May Cease to Be"

I am, however young, writing at random — straining at particles of light in the midst of a great darkness — without knowing the bearing of any one assertion, of any one opinion. Yet may I not in this be free from sin?
JOHN KEATS, letter to George and Georgiana Keats, Mar. 19, 1819
%
Wherein lies happiness? In that which becks
Our ready minds to fellowship divine,
A fellowship with essence; till we shine,
Full alchemiz’d, and free of space. Behold
The clear religion of heaven!
JOHN KEATS, Endymion
%
Darkling I listen; and, for many a time
I have been half in love with easeful Death,
Call'd him soft names in many a musèd rhyme,
To take into the air my quiet breath;
Now more than ever seems it rich to die,
To cease upon the midnight with no pain,
While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad
In such an ecstasy!
JOHN KEATS, "Ode to a Nightingale"
%
We hate poetry that has a palpable design upon us — and if we do not agree, seems to put its hand in its breeches pocket. Poetry should be great and unobtrusive, a thing which enters into one's soul, and does not startle or amaze with itself, but with its subject.
JOHN KEATS, letter to John Hamilton Reynolds, Feb. 3, 1818
%
Ever let the Fancy roam,
Pleasure never is at home.
JOHN KEATS, "Fancy"
%
But strength alone though of the Muses born
Is like a fallen angel: trees uptorn,
Darkness, and worms, and shrouds, and sepulchres
Delight it; for it feeds upon the burrs,
And thorns of life; forgetting the great end
Of poesy, that it should be a friend
To sooth the cares, and lift the thoughts of man.
JOHN KEATS, "Sleep and Poetry"
%
In drear-nighted December,
Too happy, happy tree,
Thy branches ne'er remember
Their green felicity.
JOHN KEATS, "In Drear-Nighted December"

To Sorrow
I bade good-morrow,
And thought to leave her far away behind;
But cheerly, cheerly,
She loves me dearly;
She is so constant to me, and so kind:
I would deceive her
And so leave her,
But ah! she is so constant and so kind.
JOHN KEATS, Endymion
%
There is a budding morrow in midnight.
JOHN KEATS, "Standing alone in giant ignorance"

Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness!
Close bosom friend of the maturing sun

Health is my expected heaven.
JOHN KEATS, Letters of John Keats
%
My passions are all asleep from my having slumbered till nearly eleven and weakened the animal fibre all over me to a delightful sensation about three degrees on this sight of faintness -- if I had teeth of pearl and the breath of lilies I should call it langour -- but as I am I must call it laziness. In this state of effeminacy the fibres of the brain are relaxed in common with the rest of the body, and to such a happy degree that pleasure has no show of enticement and pain no unbearable frown. Neither poetry, nor ambition, nor love have any alertness of countenance as they pass by me.
JOHN KEATS, letter to his brother and sister-in-law, George and Georgiana Keats, 1819
