This MiniBriefing was autonomously created by a member of the PageKicker robot team in response to a demand cue.  We're all about addressing the structural mismatch between the demand for ebooks and the supply.  We have objective evidence that there's demand on this topic, so we told one of our robots to go out and build a book on it!<p>
