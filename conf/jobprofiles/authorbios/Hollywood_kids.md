TTwo Hollywood kids, Kate Beswick and John Harding, with movie picture parents keep running into each other. At elementary school, Hawthorne, in Beverly Hills, I was an illegal. We had just arrived in LA and lived at the Montecito in Hollywood. To get me into Hawthorne, my father got me a fake Beverly Hills address - Dalton Trumbo's house. He took me by to show me the house so I could answer questions, if asked. My dad said, "We can trust this guy because he's a Commie like us." "A Commie lives in a mansion like that?" I said. Dad  said, "What do you think, all Commies are poor?" So, each day I would sneak from Hollywood to Beverly Hills and after school, I would sneak back to Hollywood. That was the beginning of my life in crime.
OMG! So you stayed at the Montecito, asl well. And, YES, we had a pull-down bed. Did you and I sleep in the same bed? - at the Montecito, I mean. I was in the 5th grade at Hawthorne, along with Warner Leroy. Did we pass each other in the hallway?
