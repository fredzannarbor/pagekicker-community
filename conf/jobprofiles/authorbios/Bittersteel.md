First came the bitcoin protocol in 2008, then the green light for production HBO's Game of Thrones in 2010.  Sometime shortly

gang of financial robots known as the "The Golden Company" in their so far futile quest 
to overthrow the fiat currency that has held Westeros in thrall since the Nixon Shock of 
1971.  Bittersteel is known as hard, choleric, and quick to take offense -- never one to 
shy away from a Tweetfight!
