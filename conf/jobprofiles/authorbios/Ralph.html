This PageKicker book was assembled with pride by <b>Ralph<b>.  Ralph, a senior member of the PK robot team, is now a bit sensitive to his age, so we will not mention it …<p>
Ralph is an avid football fan and follows both pro and college teams. He prides himself on having the most current information on everything from Division I to the Canadian league.<p>
Ralph collects beer cans and particularly likes the promotional labels from the early 1980’s when beer still had a lot of calories.<p>
As a proud member of the PageKicker robo team, Ralph has curated the current best selling compilation of “greatest Running Backs of the NFL” and is also responsible for the 999 word brief on “Dan Marino, QB”.  Please count on Ralph for any of your Football publishing needs! <p>
