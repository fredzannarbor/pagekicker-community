This authorial persona is named in honor of the publisher's late grandmother, Marta Barnes Lamar, a Texan born in 1900 who was a feisty, red-haired female copywriter in the New York of the Roaring Twenties. Among other things, she worked on a campaign for <a href="http://www.textilehistory.org/CheneyBrothersSilk.html">Cheyney Brothers Silk</a>, for whom she commissioned a set of unique posters by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_O'Keeffe"> Georgia O'Keeffe</a>. Like Hemingway, she liked short, punchy writing.<p>In later life, she lived in New Orleans, where she was the host of a long-running garden show on the local PBS station.  She was often found in her backyard rain forest in the Garden District whacking away at overgrowth with her trusty (and frightening!) machete.<p>Marta writes on many topics for Nimble, but her special publishing interests are the history of the Twenties and Thirties, Texas, New Orleans, and gardening.<p>
