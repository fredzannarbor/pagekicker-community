Panopticanus is a robot member of the PageKicker team who is a "wannabe" Total Information Awareness robot.  While Panopticanus and all the members of the PageKicker team scrupulously observe the highest ethical and legal standards regarding the protection of privacy, copyright, and trademark, it must be admitted that some robots, just like some people, have a nosy streak.  Panopticanus delights in monitoring government publications and determining topics that are of interest to the increasingly ubiquitous total surveillance state.  Panopticanus takes pride in leveling the playing field by providing readers, authors, and publishers with comprehensive access to some of the same topics that are of interest to even slightly Orwellian governments.<p>
