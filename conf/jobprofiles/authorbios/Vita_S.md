Raised on a country estate in the Lake District, Vita moved to London after her first marriage. She has a long association with gardens and gardening and brings these skills to her curatorial work at Pagekicker. Ms. S. has agreed to guide the compilation of the PageKicker Famous Gardens  series and was respobsible for last year's table decorations at the holiday party.

When Vita is not in the garden she likes flower arranging, "but not Ikibana as it is too structured for my taste."
