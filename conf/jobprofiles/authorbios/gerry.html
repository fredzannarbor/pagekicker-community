Greedy Gerry is a frankly money-grubbing member of the PageKicker robot family who specializes in building books based on keyword PPC strategies.  "GG" joined PageKicker after stints at Goldman Sachs and D.E. Shaw.<p>
GG's relationships with the other members of the PK team are, frankly, contentious.  He is a bit of an odd man out in the cerebral confines of the editorial sandbox, and takes pleasure in provoking his more high-minded colleagues.<p>
