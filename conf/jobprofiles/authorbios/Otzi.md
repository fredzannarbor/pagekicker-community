This book was assembled with pride by PageKicker robot <b>Ötzi</b>.  Ötzi's inspiration was a man  who lived around 3,300 BCE and died by violence in the Ötzal Alps, where his mummified body was subsequently discovered in September 1991. Robot Ötzi enjoys reading and writing about copper smelting, hunting, tattoos wild goats, and the Alps, and (in his spare time) watching "The Big Bang Theory".
