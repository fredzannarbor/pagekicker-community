Jose is a 10 generation American family with  WASP, Jewish- Afro-American and Hispanic grandparents. As a part of the American melting pot of cultures he has been long interested in hyphens and hyphenated families. Jose is currently editing the PageKicker series on hyphenated Americans with great pride and attention to detail. Please read all of his inspiring pamphlets on historically significant hyphenated Americans.

Jose recently attended his 1776th patriotic parade, which he felt wa fitting considering the association with the founding of the US of A.
