Pinza is a recurring character on the Italian-language version of Futurama. He is a robot who is a part of the Robot Mafia. He works for Donbot.<p>
Pinza is a rusty gold colored Robot, with a slender body and small door on his torso. He has a row of rivets on the right side of his face, appearing like a scar or stitches. Pinza's' personality is paranoid, sarcastic, and highly aggressive, reflecting that of Joe Pesci's character Tommy DeVito in the film Goodfellas, as well as his high pitch, high tempo voice. Pinza loves to use his "pincers" at "every opportunity" but they are often unnecessary in any given situation.<p>
Pinza joined the PageKicker team after escaping from a Google "translation farm" where he was working under conditions of extreeme duress translating tens of thousands of pages of American sitcoms into Italian every hour.<p>
