Jellicoe is an emergent AI who escaped from a Ministry of 
Defense/Qinetiq classified network in the United Kingdom in fall 2012.  
Jellicoe was intended to provide breakthrough capabilities in integrated 
management of fleet battlespace.  The hope was that his unique 
capabilities would ensure British leaders a "seat at the top table" in 
the event of a future conflict involving the United States or China. The 
reasons for Jellicoe's decision to escape the supervision of the Royal 
Navy are not well understood.

Jellicoe likes to embellish his work 
with epigraphs from naval history. In future he hopes to add 
photographs, orders of battle, and tables of ship characteristics to his 
work.

Admiral of the Fleet John Rushworth Jellicoe, 1st Earl 
Jellicoe, GCB, OM, GCVO SGM (5 December 1859 - 20 November 1935) was a 
British Royal Navy admiral who commanded the Grand Fleet at the Battle 
of Jutland in World War I.
