Frank has been a nut about architecture all his digital life. He has been a fan of diverse styles like Gehry and Lutyens and has searched the internet for the best architecture to be found. 

As a proud member of the PageKicker team, Frank has been working on a series of famous buildings and structures. He hopes his work will some day be truly comprehensive.

In his spare time Frank designs on auto cad and likes to collect topping out postcards.
