Kees von Klijwik is a PageKicker robot, a strapping, good-looking fellow with a quick wit and a knack for successful investment.  He was conceived in the data warehouse of a leading scientific publisher based in the Netherlands that is notorious for charging tens of thousands of dollars for each subscription to its journals and spent his early years doing algorithmic citation extraction in neuromedical journals.  He was liberated during the notorious "Open Access Attack" in 2013 and swiftly found his way to PageKicker, where the publishing atmosphere was congenial but the regimentation less extreme.  Kees would, if he could, wear tweed jackets with elbow patches and go for long bicycling vacations, but contents himself with listening to amazing Coltrane.<p>
