builder needs to do a better job of handling cases where wikipedia returns zero results.

Flow:

1.  Check for results from all sources.
2. If results are all zero, then abort.
3. If results are insufficient, then abort.
4. If results are not sufficient for text analysis, don't do it.
5. If results are not sufficient for word cloud, don't build it.'
6. Create chapter for grep hits in Content Collections chapter.
